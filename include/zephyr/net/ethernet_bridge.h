 * into promiscuous mode, all packets received by this interface are sent
 * to the bridge, and any other packets sent to the bridge (with some
 * exceptions) are transmitted via this interface.
 *
 * For transmission from the bridge to occur via this interface, it is
 * necessary to enable TX mode with eth_bridge_iface_tx(). TX mode is
 * initially disabled.
 *
 * Once an interface is added to a bridge, all its incoming traffic is
 * diverted to the bridge. However, packets sent out with net_if_queue_tx()
 * via this interface are not subjected to the bridge.
