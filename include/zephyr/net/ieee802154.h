 * @ingroup connectivity
 *
 * @brief IEEE 802.15.4 native and OpenThread L2, configuration, management and
 * driver APIs
 *
 * @details The IEEE 802.15.4 and Thread subsystems comprise the OpenThread L2
 * subsystem, the native IEEE 802.15.4 L2 subsystem ("Soft" MAC), a mostly
 * vendor and protocol agnostic driver API shared between the OpenThread and
 * native L2 stacks ("Hard" MAC and PHY) as well as several APIs to configure
 * the subsystem (shell, net management, Kconfig, devicetree, etc.).
 *
 * The **OpenThread subsystem API** integrates the external <a
 * href="https://openthread.io">OpenThread</a> stack into Zephyr. It builds upon
 * Zephyr's native IEEE 802.15.4 driver API.
 *
 * The **native IEEE 802.15.4 subsystem APIs** are exposed at different levels
 * and address several audiences:
 *  - shell (end users, application developers):
 *    - a set of IEEE 802.15.4 shell commands (see `shell> ieee802154 help`)
 *  - application API (application developers):
 *    - IPv6, DGRAM and RAW sockets for actual peer-to-peer, multicast and
 *      broadcast data exchange between nodes including connection specific
 *      configuration (sample coming soon, see
 *      https://github.com/linux-wpan/wpan-tools/tree/master/examples for now
 *      which inspired our API and therefore has a similar socket API),
 *    - Kconfig and devicetree configuration options (net config library
 *      extension, subsystem-wide MAC and PHY Kconfig/DT options, driver/vendor
 *      specific Kconfig/DT options, watch out for options prefixed with
 *      IEEE802154/ieee802154),
 *    - Network Management: runtime configuration of the IEEE 802.15.4
 *      protocols stack at the MAC (L2) and PHY (L1) levels
 *      (see @ref ieee802154_mgmt),
 *  - L2 integration (subsystem contributors):
 *    - see @ref ieee802154_l2
 *    - implementation of Zephyr's internal L2-level socket and network context
 *      abstractions (context/socket operations, see @ref net_l2),
 *    - protocol-specific extension to the interface structure (see @ref net_if)
 *    - protocol-specific extensions to the network packet structure
 *      (see @ref net_pkt),
 *
 *  - OpenThread and native IEEE 802.15.4 share a common **driver API** (driver
 *    maintainers/contributors):
 *    - see @ref ieee802154_driver
 *    - a basic, mostly PHY-level driver API to be implemented by all drivers,
 *    - several "hard MAC" (hardware/firmware offloading) extension points for
 *      performance critical or timing sensitive aspects of the protocol
