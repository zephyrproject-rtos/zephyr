/**
 * @brief Multi-heap allocator
 *
 * A sys_multi_heap represents a single allocator made from multiple,
 * separately managed pools of memory that must be accessed via a
 * unified API.  They can be discontiguous, and in many cases will be
 * expected to have different capabilities (for example: latency,
 * cacheability, cpu affinity, etc...)
 *
 * Allocation from the multiheap provides an opaque "configuration"
 * value to specify requirements and heuristics to assist the choice
 * in backend, which is then provided to a user-specified "choice"
 * function whose job it is to select a heap based on information in
 * the config specifier and runtime state (heap full state, etc...)

 * a specific sys_heap backend based on the opaque cfg value, which is
 * specified by the user as an argument to sys_multi_heap_alloc(), and
 * performing the allocation on behalf of the caller.  The callback is
 * free to choose any registered heap backend to perform the
 * allocation, and may choose to pad the user-provided values as
 * needed, and to use an aligned allocation where required by the
 * specified configuration.
 *
