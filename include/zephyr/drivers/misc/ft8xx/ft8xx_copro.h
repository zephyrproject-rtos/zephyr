/**
 * @brief Track touches for a graphics object
 *
 * This command will enable co-processor engine to track the touch on the
 * particular graphics object with one valid tag value assigned. Then,
 * co-processor engine will update the REG_TRACKER periodically with the frame
 * rate of LCD display panel.
 *
 * Co-processor engine tracks the graphics object in rotary tracker mode and
 * linear tracker mode:
 *
 * - Rotary tracker mode
 *   Track the angle between the touching point and the center of graphics
 *   object specified by @p tag value. The value is in units of 1/65536 of a
 *   circle. 0 means that the angle is straight down, 0x4000 left, 0x8000 up,
 *   and 0xC000 right from the center.
 * - Linear tracker mode
 *   If @p w is greater than @p h, track the relative distance of touching point
 *   to the width of graphics object specified by @p tag value. If @p w is not
 *   greater than @p h, Track the relative distance of touching point to the
 *   height of graphics object specified by @p tag value. The value is in units
 *   of 1/65536 of the width or height of graphics object. The distance of
 *   touching point refers to the distance from the top left pixel of graphics
 *   object to the coordinate of touching point.
 *
 * For linear tracker functionality, @p x represents x-coordinate of track area
 * top-left and @p y represents y-coordinate of track area top-left. Both
 * parameters are in pixels.
 *
 * For rotary tracker functionality, @p x represents x-coordinate of track area
 * center and @p y represents y-coordinate of track area center. Both
 * parameters are in pixels.
 *
 * @note A @p w and @p h of (1,1) means that the tracker is rotary, and reports
 *       an angle value in REG_TRACKER. A @p w and @p h of (0,0) disables the
 *       track functionality of co-processor engine.
 *
 * @param x x-coordinate
 * @param y y-coordinate
 * @param w Width of track area, in pixels.
 * @param h Height of track area, in pixels.
 * @param tag Tag of the graphics object to be tracked, 1-255
