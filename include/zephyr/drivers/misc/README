Miscellaneous Drivers

Misc (or miscellaneous) drivers are device drivers that do not expose generic
Zephyr Device Drivers API. Such drivers have only device-specific API providing
functionalities not covered by any Generic Device Driver API.

This directory contains header files of the Miscellaneous Drivers.


* FT8xx

  Embedded Video Engine containing graphic controller, audio processing, and
  resistive touch controller. The graphic controller does not provide frame
  buffer required by generic display driver API. Instead, it exposes higher
  layer graphic operations like widgets, shapes, fonts, text, or bitmaps
  rendering. These operations are controlled by a vendor-specific API designed
  for this device.

* STM32 Wake-up Pins
  STM32 wake-up pins are part of the Power Control (PWR) peripheral.
  They can be used to wake-up the system from Poweroff through GPIO pins.
