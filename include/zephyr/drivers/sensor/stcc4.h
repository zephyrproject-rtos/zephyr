 * down using the enter_sleep_mode command. 2. The I2C controller sends a
 * measure_single_shot command and waits for the execution time. 3. The I2C

 * 1. Operate the STCC4 for at least 3 minutes. Ensure the sensor reading and
 * environmental conditions, including CO2 concentration, are stable. 2. The I2C
 * controller sends the stop_continuous_measurement command (Section 5.3.2) 3.
 * Wait for the specified execution time of stop_continuous_measurement command.
 * 4. Issue the perform_forced_recalibration command with the target CO2
 * concentration and read out the applied FRC correction.
 *
 * The recommended communication sequence for a successful FRC in single shot
 * mode is as follows: 1. Operate the STCC4 for at least 3 minutes. For sampling
 * intervals significantly larger than 10 seconds, increase the operation time
 * accordingly. Ensure the sensor reading and environmental conditions,
 * including CO2 concentration, are stable. 2. Issue the
 * perform_forced_recalibration command with the reference CO2 concentration and
 * read out the applied FRC correction. The sensor must remain in idle mode
 * after operation before command execution.
