 * @brief Memory Domain
 *
 * A memory domain is a collection of memory partitions, used to represent
 * a user thread's access policy for the linear address space. A thread
 * may be a member of only one memory domain, but any memory domain may
 * have multiple threads that are members.
 *
 * Supervisor threads may also be a member of a memory domain; this has
 * no implications on their memory access but can be useful as any child
 * threads inherit the memory domain membership of the parent.
 *
 * A user thread belonging to a memory domain with no active partitions
 * will have guaranteed access to its own stack buffer, program text,
 * and read-only data.
