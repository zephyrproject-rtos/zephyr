# FindTargetTools module for locating a set of tools to use on the host but
# targeting a remote target for Zephyr development.
#
# This module will lookup following target tools for Zephyr development:
# +---------------------------------------------------------------+
# | Tool               | Required |  Notes:                       |
# +---------------------------------------------------------------+
# | Target C-compiler  | Yes      |                               |
# | Target Assembler   | Yes      |                               |
# | Target linker      | Yes      |                               |
# +---------------------------------------------------------------+
#
# The module defines the following variables:
#
# 'CMAKE_C_COMPILER'
# Path to target C compiler.
# Set to 'CMAKE_C_COMPILER-NOTFOUND' if no C compiler was found.
#
# 'TargetTools_FOUND', 'TARGETTOOLS_FOUND'
# True if all required host tools were found.

#   The name of the operating system for which CMake is to build.
#
# https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/wikis/doc/cmake/CrossCompiling:
#   CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME : this one is mandatory, it is the name of the target
#   system, i.e. the same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME would have if CMake would run
#   on the target system.  Typical examples are "Linux" and "Windows". This
#   variable is used for constructing the file names of the platform files
#   like Linux.cmake or Windows-gcc.cmake. If your target is an embedded
#   system without OS set CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME to "Generic".

#   CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR : optional, processor (or hardware) of the
#   target system. This variable is not used very much except for one
#   purpose, it is used to load a
#   CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME-compiler-CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR.cmake file,
#   which can be used to modify settings like compiler flags etc. for
#   the target

#   explicitly to specify the target system version.

# https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_LANG_BYTE_ORDER.html

# this setting to allow users to read the standard CMake variable or use
# 'test_big_endian()' function.
