# Zephyr Memory Storage ZMS

config ZMS
	bool "Zephyr Memory Storage"
	select CRC
	help
	  Enable Zephyr Memory Storage, which is a key-value storage system designed to work with
	  all types of non-volatile storage technologies.
	  It supports classical on-chip NOR flash as well as new technologies like RRAM and MRAM.

if ZMS

config ZMS_LOOKUP_CACHE
	bool "ZMS lookup cache"
	help
	  Enable ZMS cache to reduce the ZMS data lookup time.
	  Each cache entry holds an address of the most recent allocation
	  table entry (ATE) for all ZMS IDs that fall into that cache position.

config ZMS_LOOKUP_CACHE_SIZE
	int "ZMS lookup cache size"
	default 128
	range 1 65536
	depends on ZMS_LOOKUP_CACHE
	help
	  Number of entries in the ZMS lookup cache.
	  Every additional entry in cache will use 8 bytes of RAM.

config ZMS_DATA_CRC
	bool "ZMS data CRC"

config ZMS_CUSTOMIZE_BLOCK_SIZE
	bool "Customize the size of the buffer used internally for reads and writes"
	help
	  ZMS uses an internal buffer to read/write and compare stored data.
	  Increasing the size of this buffer should be done carefully in order to not
	  overflow the stack.
	  Increasing it makes ZMS able to work with storage devices
	  that have a larger `write-block-size` (which decreases the performance of ZMS).

config ZMS_CUSTOM_BLOCK_SIZE
	int "ZMS internal buffer size"
	default 32
	depends on ZMS_CUSTOMIZE_BLOCK_SIZE
	help
	  Changes the internal buffer size of ZMS

config ZMS_NO_DOUBLE_WRITE
	bool "Avoid writing the same data again in the storage"
	help
	  For some memory technologies, write cycles for memory cells are limited and any
	  unncessary writes should be avoided.
	  Enable this config to avoid rewriting data in the storage if it already exists.
	  This option will reduce write performance as it will need to do a research of the
	  data in the whole storage before any write.
