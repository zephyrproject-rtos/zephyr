config NVS

	select CRC
	help
	  Enable support of Non-volatile Storage.

if NVS

config NVS_LOOKUP_CACHE
	bool "Non-volatile Storage lookup cache"
	help
	  Enable Non-volatile Storage cache, used to reduce the NVS data lookup
	  time. Each cache entry holds an address of the most recent allocation
	  table entry (ATE) for all NVS IDs that fall into that cache position.

config NVS_LOOKUP_CACHE_SIZE
	int "Non-volatile Storage lookup cache size"
	default 128
	range 1 65536
	depends on NVS_LOOKUP_CACHE
	help
	  Number of entries in Non-volatile Storage lookup cache.
	  It is recommended that it be a power of 2.

config NVS_LOOKUP_CACHE_FOR_SETTINGS
	bool "Non-volatile Storage lookup cache optimized for settings"
	depends on NVS_LOOKUP_CACHE
	help
	  Use the lookup cache hash function that results in the least number of
	  collissions and, in turn, the best NVS performance provided that the NVS
	  is used as the settings backend only. This option should NOT be enabled
	  if the NVS is also written to directly, outside the settings layer.

config NVS_DATA_CRC
	bool "Non-volatile Storage CRC protection on the data"
	help
	  Enable a CRC-32 on the data part of each NVS element.
	  The ATE CRC is not impacted by this feature and stays the same.
	  The CRC-32 is transparently stored at the end of the data field,
	  in the NVS data section, so 4 more bytes are needed per NVS element.

config NVS_INIT_BAD_MEMORY_REGION
	bool "Non-volatile Storage bad memory region recovery"
	help
	  Enable automatic initialization of a NVS on a memory region that does
	  not contain a valid NVS. A region containing an invalid NVS can be
	  caused by corruption or by providing a non-empty region. This option
	  ensures a new NVS can be created.
