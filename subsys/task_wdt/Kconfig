menuconfig TASK_WDT
	bool "Task-level software watchdog"
	select REBOOT
	help
	  Enable task watchdog

	  The task watchdog allows to have individual watchdog channels
	  per thread, even if the hardware supports only a single watchdog.

if TASK_WDT
config TASK_WDT_CHANNELS
	int "Maximum number of task watchdog channels"
	default 5
	range 2 100
	help
	  The timeouts for each channel are stored in an array. Allocate only
	  the required amount of channels to reduce memory footprint.

config TASK_WDT_HW_FALLBACK
	bool "Use hardware watchdog as a fallback"
	default y
	help
	  This option allows to specify a hardware watchdog device in the
	  application that is used as an additional safety layer if the task
	  watchdog itself gets stuck.

config TASK_WDT_MIN_TIMEOUT
	int "Minimum timeout for task watchdog (ms)"
	depends on TASK_WDT_HW_FALLBACK
	default 100
	range 1 10000
	help
	  The task watchdog uses a continuously restarted k_timer as its
	  backend. This value specifies the minimum timeout in milliseconds
	  among all task watchdogs used in the application.

	  If a hardware watchdog is configured as a fallback for the task
	  watchdog, its timeout is set to this value plus
	  TASK_WDT_HW_FALLBACK_DELAY.

config TASK_WDT_HW_FALLBACK_DELAY
	int "Additional delay for hardware watchdog (ms)"
	depends on TASK_WDT_HW_FALLBACK
	default 20
	range 1 1000
	help
	  The timeout of the hardware watchdog fallback will be increased by
	  this value to provide sufficient time for corrective actions in the
	  callback function.

	  In addition to that, the delay allows to compensate deviations
	  between different clock sources for the hardware watchdog and the
	  kernel timer. This is especially important if the hardware watchdog
	  is clocked by an inaccurate low-speed RC oscillator.

config TASK_WDT_SHELL
	bool "Task watchdog shell utilities"
	depends on SHELL
	help
	  Activate shell module that provides Task watchdog commands.
