config NET_RAW_MODE
	bool
	default n
	help
	  This is a very specific option used to built only the very minimal
	  part of the net stack in order to get network drivers working without
	  any net stack above: core, L2 etc... Basically this will build only
	  net_pkt part. It is currently used only by IEEE 802.15.4 drivers,
	  though any type of net drivers could use it.

config NET_INIT_PRIO

	  The value depends on your network needs.

config NET_TCP_CHECKSUM

	  The number of simultaneous TCP connection attempts, i.e. outstanding
	  TCP connections waiting for initial ACK.

config NET_TCP_TIME_WAIT
	bool "Enable TCP TIME_WAIT timeouts"
	depends on NET_TCP
	default n
	help
	  Officially, the TCP standard requires a 4 minute timeout on
	  connection close before that particular port pair can be used
	  again.  This requires that the net_context and net_tcp structs
	  persist for the full duration, so has non-trivial memory costs
	  and is optional.  Modern systems with well-randomized sequence
	  numbers don't need this, but it is present for specification
	  compliance where needed.

config NET_TCP_2MSL_TIME
	int "How long to wait in TIME_WAIT (in seconds)"
	depends on NET_TCP_TIME_WAIT
	default 240
	help
	  The value is in seconds.

config NET_TCP_ACK_TIMEOUT
	int "How long to wait for ACK (in milliseconds)"
	depends on NET_TCP
	default 1000
	range 1 2147483647
	help
	  This value affects the timeout when waiting ACK to arrive in
	  various TCP states. The value is in milliseconds. Note that
	  having a very low value here could prevent connectivity.

config NET_TCP_INIT_RETRANSMISSION_TIMEOUT
	int "Initial value of Retransmission Timeout (RTO) (in milliseconds)"
	depends on NET_TCP
	default 200
	range 100 60000
	help
	  This value affects the timeout between initial retransmission
	  of TCP data packets. The value is in milliseconds.

config NET_TCP_RETRY_COUNT
	int "Maximum number of TCP segment retransmissions"
	depends on NET_TCP
	default 9
	help
	  The following formula can be used to determine the time (in ms)
	  that a segment will be be buffered awaiting retransmission:
	  n=NET_TCP_RETRY_COUNT
	  Sum((1<<n) * NET_TCP_INIT_RETRANSMISSION_TIMEOUT)
	  n=0
	  With the default value of 9, the IP stack will try to
	  retransmit for up to 1:42 minutes.  This is as close as possible
	  to the minimum value recommended by RFC1122 (1:40 minutes).
	  Only 5 bits are dedicated for the retransmission count, so accepted
	  values are in the 0-31 range.  It's highly recommended to not go
	  below 9, though.
	  Should a retransmission timeout occur, the receive callback is
	  called with -ECONNRESET error code and the context is dereferenced.

config NET_UDP
	bool "Enable UDP"
	default y
	help
	  The value depends on your network needs.

config NET_UDP_CHECKSUM
	bool "Check UDP checksum"
	default y
	depends on NET_UDP
	help
	  Enables UDP handler to check UDP checksum. If the checksum is invalid,

	depends on NET_UDP || NET_TCP
	default 4
	default 8 if NET_IPV6 && NET_IPV4
	help
	  The value depends on your network needs. The value
	  should include both UDP and TCP connections.

config NET_CONN_CACHE
	bool "Cache network connections"
	depends on NET_UDP || NET_TCP
	default n
	help
	  Caching takes slight more memory but will speedup connection
	  handling of UDP and TCP connections.

config NET_MAX_CONTEXTS
	int "Number of network contexts to allocate"
	default 6
	help
	  Each network context is used to describe a network 5-tuple that
	  is used when listening or sending network traffic. This is very
	  similar as one could call a network socket in some other systems.

config NET_CONTEXT_NET_PKT_POOL
	bool "Enable net_buf TX pool / context"
	default n
	default y if NET_TCP && NET_6LO
	help
	  If enabled, then it is possible to fine-tune network packet pool
	  for each context when sending network data. If this setting is
	  enabled, then you should define the context pools in your application
	  using NET_PKT_TX_POOL_DEFINE() and NET_PKT_DATA_POOL_DEFINE()
	  macros and tie these pools to desired context using the
	  net_context_setup_pools() function.

config NET_CONTEXT_SYNC_RECV
	bool "Support synchronous functionality in net_context_recv() API"
	default y
	help
	  You can disable sync support to save some memory if you are calling
	  net_context_recv() in async way only when timeout is set to 0.

config NET_CONTEXT_CHECK
	bool "Check options when calling various net_context functions"
	default y
	help
	  If you know that the options passed to net_context...() functions
	  are ok, then you can disable the checks to save some memory.

config NET_TEST
	bool "Network Testing"
	default n
	help
	  Used for self-contained networking tests that do not require a
	  network device.

config NET_SLIP_TAP

	select UART_PIPE
	select UART_INTERRUPT_DRIVEN
	select SLIP_TAP
	default n
	default y if (QEMU_TARGET && !NET_TEST && !NET_L2_BT)
	help
	  SLIP TAP support is necessary when testing with QEMU. The host
	  needs to have tunslip6 with TAP support running in order to
	  communicate via the SLIP driver. See net-tools project at
	  https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/net-tools for more details.

config NET_TRICKLE

config NET_BUF_TX_COUNT
	int "How many network buffers are allocated for sending data"
	default 16
	help
	  Each data buffer will occupy CONFIG_NET_BUF_DATA_SIZE + smallish

config NET_BUF_DATA_SIZE
	int "Size of each network data fragment"
	default 128
	default 125 if NET_L2_IEEE802154
	help
	  This value tells what is the size of the data fragment that is
	  received from the network.
	  Example: For IEEE 802.15.4, the network packet is 127 bytes long,
	  which leaves in worst case 81 bytes for user data (MTU).
	  In order to be able to receive at least full IPv6 packet which
	  has a size of 1280 bytes, the one should allocate 16 fragments here.

config NET_BUF_USER_DATA_SIZE
	int "Size of user_data reserved"
	default 0
	default 4 if NET_L2_BT
	help
	  This is for drivers to set how much user_data shall be included in
	  each network data fragment.
	  Example: For Bluetooth, the user_data shall be at least 4 bytes as
	  that is used for identifying the type of data they are carrying.
