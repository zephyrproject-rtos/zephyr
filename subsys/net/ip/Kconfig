	help
	  To avoid a (low-probability) issue when delayed packets from
	  previous connection get delivered to next connection reusing
	  the same local/remote ports, RFC 793 (TCP) suggests to keep
	  an old, closed connection in a special "TIME_WAIT" state for
	  the duration of 2*MSL (Maximum Segment Lifetime). The RFC
	  suggests to use MSL of 2 minutes, but notes "This is an
	  engineering choice, and may be changed if experience indicates
	  it is desirable to do so." For low-resource systems, having
	  large MSL may lead to quick resource exhaustion (and related
	  DoS attacks). At the same time, the issue of packet misdelivery
	  is largely alleviated in the modern TCP stacks by using random,
	  non-repeating port numbers and initial sequence numbers. Due
	  to this, Zephyr uses much lower value of 1500ms by default.

	  n=0
	  With the default value of 9, the IP stack will try to
	  retransmit for up to 1:42 minutes.  This is as close as possible
	  to the minimum value recommended by RFC1122 (1:40 minutes).
	  Only 5 bits are dedicated for the retransmission count, so accepted
	  values are in the 0-31 range.  It's highly recommended to not go
