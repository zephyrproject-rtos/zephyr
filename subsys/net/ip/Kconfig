	The SLIP support is only used when the application is

	The SLIP support is only used when the application is
	run inside QEMU and the network peer is run in your
	host. The host needs to have tunslip running in order
	to receive and send network packets via the SLIP driver.
	The SLIP driver Kconfig options can be tweaked in drivers
	section.
	Options are provided to communicate with QEMU via a TUN driver,
	the default, as it requires less configuration in the host side,
	or via a TAP driver.
config NET_SLIP_TUN

	select SLIP
	select UART_PIPE
	select UART_INTERRUPT_DRIVEN

	SLIP TAP support is necessary when testing IPv4/ARP. The host

	communicate via the SLIP driver.

	help
	Each data buffer will occupy CONFIG_NBUF_DATA_SIZE + smallish
	header (sizeof(struct net_buf)) amount of data.

config NET_NBUF_DATA_SIZE
	int "Size of each network data fragment"
	default 128
	default 125 if NET_L2_IEEE802154
	help
	This value tells what is the size of the data fragment that is
	received from the network.
	Example: For IEEE 802.15.4, the network packet is 127 bytes long,
	which leaves in worst case 81 bytes for user data (MTU).
	In order to be able to receive at least full IPv6 packet which
	has a size of 1280 bytes, the one should allocate 16 fragments here.

config NET_NBUF_USER_DATA_SIZE
	int "Size of user_data reserved"
	default 0
	default 4 if NET_L2_BLUETOOTH
	help
	This is for drivers to set how much user_data shall be included in
	each network data fragment.
	Example: For Bluetooth, the user_data shall be at least 4 bytes as
	that is used for identifying the type of data they are carrying.
