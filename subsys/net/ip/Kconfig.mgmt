menuconfig NET_MGMT
	bool "Network Management API"
	help
	  Add support for NM API that enables managing different aspects
	  of the network stack as well as receiving notification on network
	  events (ip address change, iface up and running ...).

config NET_MGMT_EVENT
	bool "Add support for runtime network event notifications"
	depends on NET_MGMT
	help
	  This adds support for the stack to notify events towards any
	  relevant listener. This can be necessary when application
	  (or else) needs to be notified on a specific network event
	  (ip address change for instance) to trigger some related work.

config NET_MGMT_EVENT_THREAD
	bool "Separate network events thread"
	help
	  Create a dedicated thread for network event callback handlers.
	  If NET_MGMT_EVENT_INFO is enabled the data will be copied to
	  a message queue.

config NET_MGMT_EVENT_SYSTEM_WORKQUEUE
	bool "System work queue"
	help
	  Submit work to the system work queue to schedule calling network
	  event callback handlers.
	  If NET_MGMT_EVENT_INFO is enabled the data will be copied to
	  a message queue.

config NET_MGMT_EVENT_DIRECT
	bool "Trigger callback on event emit"
	help
	  Call network event handlers when the event is emitted.
	  If NET_MGMT_EVENT_INFO is enabled a data pointer is passed to
	  callback handlers, no info data is copied.

	help
	  Numbers of events which can be queued at same time. Note that if a
	  3rd event comes in, the first will be removed without generating any
	  notification. Thus the size of this queue has to be tweaked depending
	  on the load of the system, planned for the usage.

	  wait for the queue to be available.

config NET_MGMT_EVENT_INFO
	bool "Passing information along with an event"
	help
	  Event notifier will be able to provide information to an event,
	  and listeners will then be able to get it. Such information depends
	  on the type of event.

config NET_MGMT_EVENT_MONITOR
	bool "Monitor network events from net shell"
	depends on NET_SHELL && NET_MGMT_EVENT_INFO
	help
	  Allow user to monitor network events from net shell using
	  "net events [on|off]" command. The monitoring is disabled by
	  default. Note that you should probably increase the value of
	  NET_MGMT_EVENT_QUEUE_SIZE from the default in order not to miss
	  any events.

	  The default UART based shell is used to print data.
