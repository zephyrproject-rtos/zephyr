	  simulate Ethernet through SLIP.

	bool "Reserve space for Ethernet header in first net_buf in TX"
	help
	  If enabled, then reserve space for Ethernet header to the first
	  net_buf when sending data. The default is still to have layer 2
	  header in a separate net_buf. In RX side the Ethernet header
	  is always part of the first net_buf.

config NET_L2_ETHERNET_MGMT
	bool "Ethernet network management interface"
	select NET_MGMT
	select NET_MGMT_EVENT
	help
	  Enable support net_mgmt Ethernet interface which can be used to
	  configure at run-time Ethernet drivers and L2 settings.

	  Enables virtual lan (VLAN) support for Ethernet.

	  get IPv4 working (like Ethernet devices).

	  Each entry in the ARP table consumes 48 bytes of memory.

	depends on NET_ARP
	default y
	help
	  Gratuitous in this case means a ARP request or reply that is not
	  normally needed according to the ARP specification but could be used
	  in some cases. A gratuitous ARP request is a ARP request packet where
	  the source and destination IP are both set to the IP of the machine
	  issuing the packet and the destination MAC is the broadcast address
	  ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff. Ordinarily, no reply packet will occur.
	  A gratuitous ARP reply is a reply to which no request has been made.
