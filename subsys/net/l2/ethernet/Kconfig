	  simulate Ethernet through SLIP.

	  Enable support net_mgmt Ethernet interface which can be used to

	  Enables printing of received and sent network packets.
	  This can produce lot of output so it is disabled by default.

	depends on NET_ARP
	default y
	help
	  Gratuitous in this case means a ARP request or reply that is not
	  normally needed according to the ARP specification but could be used
	  in some cases. A gratuitous ARP request is a ARP request packet where
	  the source and destination IP are both set to the IP of the machine
	  issuing the packet and the destination MAC is the broadcast address
	  ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff. Ordinarily, no reply packet will occur.
	  A gratuitous ARP reply is a reply to which no request has been made.

	  frames are dropped at the L2 processing.
