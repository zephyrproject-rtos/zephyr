	  simulate Ethernet through SLIP.

	  Enable support net_mgmt Ethernet interface which can be used to
	  configure at run-time Ethernet drivers and L2 settings.

	  Enables printing of received and sent network packets.
	  This can produce lot of output so it is disabled by default.

	default y
	help
	  Gratuitous in this case means a ARP request or reply that is not
	  normally needed according to the ARP specification but could be used
	  in some cases. A gratuitous ARP request is a ARP request packet where
	  the source and destination IP are both set to the IP of the machine
	  issuing the packet and the destination MAC is the broadcast address
	  ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff. Ordinarily, no reply packet will occur.
	  A gratuitous ARP reply is a reply to which no request has been made.
