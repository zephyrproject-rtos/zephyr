	help
	  Add a CANBUS L2 layer driver. This is the layer for IPv6 over CAN
	  (6loCAN). It uses IPHC to compress the IP header and ISO-TP for
	  flow control and reassembling.

	  Use a fixed L2 address for 6LoCAN instead of a random chosen one.

	  Number of retries for Duplicate Address Detection.

	help
	  Minimal separation time between frames in ms.
	  The timer starts when the frame is queued and the next frame is
	  transmitted after expiration.
	  STmin is chosen by the receiver and transmitted in the FC
	  (Flow Control) frame. See also: ISO 15765-2:2016

config NET_L2_CANBUS_BS

	default 8
	range 0 256
	help
	  Number of CF (Contiguous Frame) PDUs before next FC (Flow Control)
	  frame is sent. Zero value means all frames are sent consecutive
	  without an additional FC frame.
	  A BS counter at the sender counts from one to BS. When BS is reached,
	  the sender waits for a FC frame again an BS is reset.

	  Enable a 6LoCAN Ethernet translator. With this translator it is
	  possible to connect a 6LoCAN network to a Ethernet network directly,
	  via a Switch or trough a router. Messages that goes through the
	  translator have a special address and the MAC address is carried inline.
	  The packet is forwarded with uncompressed IPv6 header.
