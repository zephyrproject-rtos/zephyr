	  Enable COBS (Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing) L2 layer.
	  This L2 performs COBS encoding/decoding on packets sent/received
	  over serial links, providing framing and byte-stuffing.

	bool "Mark RX packets as loopback (test/self-loop helper)"
	help
	  Mark received packets as loopback before passing them to the IP stack.
	  This is useful for self-loop tests where packets traverse a physical
	  medium (e.g., cross-wired UART) but still originate from a local IP
	  address. Without this, IPv6 input may drop such packets as spoofed
	  ("src addr is mine").
