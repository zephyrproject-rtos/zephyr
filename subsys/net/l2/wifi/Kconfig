config WIFI_MGMT_TWT_CHECK_IP
	bool "Check IP Assignment for TWT"
	default y
	help
	  This option enables check for valid IP address before TWT setup.
	  If TWT setup is triggered early in the connection, then device might
	  enter deep sleep without having a valid IP, this can result in device
	  being unreachable (IP Level) or unable to receive down link traffic
	  even when it is awake intervals. Rejecting TWT setup till Wi-Fi
	  interface has a valid IP address might be desirable in most scenarios.
