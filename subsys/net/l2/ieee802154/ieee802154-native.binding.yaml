  IEEE 802.15.4 MAC configuration specific to Zephyr's IEEE 802.15.4 native L2.

  Note: Please do not add PHY-specific properties to this binding file.
  Currently we do not support IEEE 802.15.4 PHY-specific configuration. Once
  drivers appear that require PHY-specific configuration, we will add
  corresponding subnode bindings for each supported channel page.

  References are to the IEEE 802.15.4-2020 standard by default.

  sec-key:
    type: string
    description: |
      The private security key to be used to decrypt and encrypt IEEE 802.15.4
      packets, 16 bytes, hex encoded, e.g. "000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f".

      Note: Currently native L2 only supports a single secKeySource, see
      section 9.5, table 9-9, in combination with secKeyMode zero (implicit key
      mode), see section 9.4.2.3, table 9-7.

      Warning: Only use this for testing. For production use, the key should be
      stored in a secure element.

      Warning: This key source / key mode combination is no longer considered
      secure in accordance with the 2015+ versions of the standard and needs to
      be extended in the future for full security procedure compliance.
  sec-key-mode:
    type: int
    description: |
      The key mode to be used for encrypted packages. Currently only key mode 0
      is supported (implicit key mode). See the description of sec-key above.
    default: 0
  sec-level:
    type: int
    description: 1;
      The security level to be used for encrypted packages, possible values are
      defined in section, 9.4.2.2, table 9-6.
    default: 0
  no-ack:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Whether an acknowledgment is required for transmitted packets.

      Sets AckTx to false for all MLME-DATA (aka TX) requests, see section 8.3.2.
