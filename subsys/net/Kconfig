	help
	  This option enables support for generic network protocol
	  buffers.

	bool "Network buffer logging"

	help
	  Enable logs and checks for the generic network buffers.

config NET_BUF_WARN_ALLOC_INTERVAL
	int "Interval of Network buffer allocation warnings"
	default 1
	range 0 60
	help
	  Interval in seconds of Network buffer allocation warnings which are
	  generated when a buffer cannot immediately be allocated with K_FOREVER
	  which may lead to deadlocks. Setting it to 0 makes warnings to be
	  printed only once per allocation.

config NET_BUF_SIMPLE_LOG
	bool "Network buffer memory debugging"
	select LOG
	help
	  Enable extra debug logs and checks for the generic network buffers.

endif # NET_BUF_LOG

config NET_BUF_POOL_USAGE
	bool "Network buffer pool usage tracking"
	help
	  Enable network buffer pool tracking. This means that:
	  * amount of free buffers in the pool is remembered
	  * total size of the pool is calculated
	  * pool name is stored and can be shown in debugging prints

config NET_BUF_ALIGNMENT
	int "Network buffer alignment restriction"
	default 0
	help
	  Alignment restriction for network buffers. This is useful for
	  some hardware IP with DMA that requires the buffers to be aligned
	  to a certain byte boundary, or dealing with cache line restrictions.
	  Default value of 0 means the alignment will be the size of a void pointer,
	  any other value will force the alignment of a net buffer in bytes.

config NETWORKING
	bool "Link layer and networking (including IP)"
	select NET_BUF
	select POLL
	select ENTROPY_GENERATOR
	help
	  This option enables generic link layer and networking support
	  and is the basis for higher level protocols (e.g. IP protocols).
