config TFTPC_DEFAULT_SERVER_IP
	string "Default IP address that the TFTP Client will try to connect to."
	default "192.168.0.100"
	help
	  TFTP Client API provides the user a way to specify the IP address of the
	  TFTP Server. This support is added for cases where the client might want
	  to communicate with multiple servers. If the user does not specify the IP
	  address of the TFTP Server, then the library will fallback to this IP.

config TFTPC_DEFAULT_SERVER_PORT
	int "Default Port that the TFTP Client will try to connect to."
	default 51000
	help
	  This option is used alongside the "TFTPC_DEFAULT_SERVER_IP" to specify the
	  default port of the TFTP Server.

config TFTPC_MAX_FILENAME_SIZE
	int "Maximum size of the filename that we can get / put to the TFTP Server."
	default 10
	help
	  Maximum size (defined in the number of characters) of each filename that we
	  can get or put to the TFTP Server. This is introduced to allow the user to scale up
	  the size of request array that is not dynamically created (as we don't like dynamic
	  memory allocations).

config TFTPC_REQUEST_TIMEOUT
	int "Maximum amount of time the TFTP Client will wait for a response from the server."
	default 5
	help
	  Maximum amount of time (in seconds) that the TFTP Client will wait for data from the
	  TFTP Server. Once this time has elasped, the TFTP Client will assume that the Server
	  failed and close the connection.

config TFTPC_REQUEST_RETRANSMITS
	int "Number of times the TFTP Client will retransmit the request and expect data from the server."
	default 5
	help
	  Once the TFTP Client sends out a request, it will wait TFTPC_REQUEST_TIMEOUT secs for the data
	  to arrive from the TFTP Server. However, if it doesn't arrive within the given time we will
	  re-transmit the request to the server in hopes that the server will respond within time to this
	  request. This number dictates the number of times we will do re-tx of our request before giving up
	  and exiting.
