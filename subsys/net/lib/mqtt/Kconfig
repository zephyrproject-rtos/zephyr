config MQTT_CLEAN_SESSION
	bool "MQTT Clean Session Flag."
	help
	  When a client connects to a MQTT broker using a persistent session,
	  the message broker saves all subscriptions. When the client
	  disconnects, the message broker stores unacknowledged QoS 1 messages
	  and new QoS 1 messages published to topics to which the client is
	  subscribed. When the client reconnects to the persistent session,
	  all subscriptions are reinstated and all stored messages are sent to
	  the client. Setting this flag to 0 allows the client to create a
	  persistent session.
