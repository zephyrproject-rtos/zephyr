config NET_DHCPV4_SERVER_INSTANCES
	int "Maximum number of DHCPv4 server instances"
	default 1
	help
	  Maximum number of DHCPv4 server instances supported by the system.
	  Each network interface that wants to act as a DHCPv4 server requires
	  a separate instance.

config NET_DHCPV4_SERVER_ADDR_COUNT
	int "Number of IPv4 addresses that can be assigned by the server"
	default 4
	help
	  Maximum number of IPv4 addresses that can be assigned by the DHCPv4
	  server instance. The base IPv4 address in the address pool is provided
	  at runtime, during server initialization. Consecutive addresses in the
	  pool have the lowest address octet incremented.

config NET_DHCPV4_SERVER_ADDR_LEASE_TIME
	int "Lease time for IPv4 addresses assigned by the server (seconds)"
	default 86400
	help
	  Lease time in seconds for IPv4 addresses assigned by the server.
	  The lease time determines when the IPv4 address lease expires if the
	  client does not renew it.

config NET_DHCPV4_SERVER_ADDR_DECLINE_TIME
	int "The time IPv4 addresses remains blocked after conflict detection (seconds)"
	default 86400
	help
	  In case IPv4 address becomes blocked (either because of receiving
	  Decline message or due to ICMP probe detecting conflict), the address
	  can no longer be assigned. This timeout specifies how long the address
	  remains in the Declined state.
	  Note, that the server may try to reuse the oldest declined address in
	  case it runs out of free addresses to assign.

config NET_DHCPV4_SERVER_ICMP_PROBE_TIMEOUT
	int "Timeout for ICMP probes sent by the server (miliseconds)"
	default 1000
	help
	  DHCPv4 server will probe the offered IP address (send ICMP echo
	  request) and wait for the time specific by this config before offering
	  the address. If set to 0, ICMP probing will be disabled.
