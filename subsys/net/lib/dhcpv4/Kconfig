	  If set, custom callbacks for arbitrary DHCP options

	  Maximum number of requested options that can be added to the
	  DHCPv4 request message. The options are added using the

	  a separate instance.

	int "Number of IPv4 addresses that can be assigned by the server"
	default 4
	help
	  Maximum number of IPv4 addresses that can be assigned by the DHCPv4
	  server instance. The base IPv4 address in the address pool is provided
	  at runtime, during server initialization. Consecutive addresses in the
	  pool have the lowest address octet incremented.

	int "Lease time for IPv4 addresses assigned by the server (seconds)"

	help
	  Lease time in seconds for IPv4 addresses assigned by the server.
	  The lease time determines when the IPv4 address lease expires if the
	  client does not renew it.

	int "Timeout for ICMP probes sent by the server (miliseconds)"

	help
	  DHCPv4 server will probe the offered IP address (send ICMP echo
	  request) and wait for the time specific by this config before offering
	  the address. If set to 0, ICMP probing will be disabled.
