	  DNS server IP address 1. The address can be either IPv4 or IPv6

	  192.0.2.1:5353
	  2001:db8::1
	  [2001:db8::1]:5353
	  It is possible to bind the DNS connection via a certain network
	  interface by appending "%" and network interface name to the server
	  address. For example: 192.0.2.1%eth1 would bind the connection socket
	  to the network interface eth1. This is optional and by default the
	  resolver connects to server by selecting the output network interface
	  using normal IP routing.
	  It is not mandatory to use this Kconfig option at all.
	  The one calling dns_resolve_init() can use this option or not
	  to populate the server list. If the DNS server addresses are
	  set here, then we automatically create default DNS context
	  for the user.

	  remove the old entries before setting up the new ones.
	  If you have only one network interface, then this can be enabled.
	  If you have multiple network interfaces, then this should be disabled
	  because the later configuration update would remove the entries
