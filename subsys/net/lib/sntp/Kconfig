	  Get a more reliable timestamp by supplying the sntp_time struct with an
	  uptime timestamp of when the time was valid and an uncertainty of the
	  time in microseconds. Time is then given as:
	  seconds,fraction +/- uncertainty at uptime timestamp.
	  Enabling this option uses more resources (memory) and is not normally
	  needed.
