config NET_CONFIG_AUTO_INIT
	bool "Init networking support automatically during device startup"
	default y
	help
	  If this option is set, then the networking system is automatically
	  initialized when the device is started. If you do not wish to do
	  this, then disable this and call net_config_init() in your application.

config NET_CONFIG_INIT_PRIO

	depends on NET_CONFIG_AUTO_INIT

config NET_CONFIG_INIT_TIMEOUT
	int "How long to wait for networking to be ready and available"
	default 30
	depends on NET_CONFIG_AUTO_INIT
	help
	  The value is in seconds. If for example IPv4 address from DHCPv4 is not
	  received within this limit, then the net_config_init() call will fail
	  during the device startup.

config NET_CONFIG_NEED_IPV6
	bool "This application wants IPv6 support"
	depends on NET_CONFIG_AUTO_INIT
	select NET_IPV6
	help
	  The network application needs IPv6 support to function properly.
	  This option makes sure the network application is initialized properly
	  in order to use IPv6.

config NET_CONFIG_NEED_IPV6_ROUTER
	bool "This application wants IPv6 router to exists"
	depends on NET_CONFIG_AUTO_INIT
	depends on NET_IPV6
	help
	  The network application needs IPv6 router to exists before continuing.
	  What this means that the application wants to wait until it receives
	  IPv6 router advertisement message before continuing.

config NET_CONFIG_NEED_IPV4
	bool "This application wants IPv4 support"
	depends on NET_CONFIG_AUTO_INIT
	select NET_IPV4
	help
	  The network application needs IPv4 support to function properly.
	  This option makes sure the network application is initialized properly
	  in order to use IPv4.

	  Beware this is not meant to be used for proper
	  provisioning but quick sampling/testing.
