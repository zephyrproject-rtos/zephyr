# OSDP_NUM_CONNECTED_PD is used in CP mode. It is a constant set to 1 when
# operating as a PD.
config OSDP_NUM_CONNECTED_PD
	int
	default 1
	help
	  In PD mode, number of connected PDs is always 1 and cannot
	  be configured.

config OSDP_PD_COMMAND_QUEUE_SIZE
	int "OSDP Peripheral Device command queue size"
	default 16
	help
	  The number of commands that can be queued to a given PD. In CP mode,
	  the queue size is multiplied by number of connected PD so this can grow
	  very quickly.

config OSDP_PD_ADDRESS
	int "Peripheral Device Address"
	default 1
	range 1 126
	help
	  The 7 least significant bits represent the address of the PD to which
	  the message is directed, or the address of the PD sending the reply.
	  Address 0x7F is reserved as a broadcast address to which all PDs would
	  respond.

config OSDP_PD_SCBK
	string "Secure Channel Base Key (SCBK)"
	default "NONE"
	help
	  Hexadecimal string representation of the 16 byte OSDP PD Secure
	  Channel Base Key. When this field is sent to "NONE", the PD is set to
	  "Install Mode". In this mode, the PD would allow a CP to setup a secure
	  channel with default SCBK. Once as secure channel is active with the
	  default key, the CP can send a KEYSET command to set new keys to the PD.
	  It is up to the user to make sure that the PD enters the "Install Mode"
	  only during provisioning time (controlled environment).

	  command from the CP.
	  - 02: Like 01, plus: The PD is able to accept configuration of the Output
	  driver to set the inactive state of the Output. The typical state of an
	  inactive Output is the state of the Output when no power is applied to the
	  PD and the output device (relay) is not energized. The inverted drive
	  setting causes the PD to energize the Output during the inactive state and
	  de-energize the Output during the active state. This feature allows the
	  support of "fail-safe/fail-secure" operating modes.
	  - 03: Like 01, plus: The PD is able to accept timed commands to the
	  Output. A timed command specifies the state of the Output for the
