	  115200.

	help
	  Prints bytes sent/received over OSDP to console for debugging.
	  LOG_HEXDUMP_DBG() is used to achieve this and can be very verbose.

config OSDP_SKIP_MARK_BYTE
	bool "Skip sending the initial marking byte (0xFF)"
	help
	  As per the OSDP specification, the first byte in the channel has
	  to be a MARK byte which is 0xFF. Since this is not stated in the
	  packet structure definition, some commercial CPs and PDs do not
	  handle the initial mark byte correctly. This option can be used to
	  completely disable sending/expecting a mark byte to work with
	  such non-conforming devices.
