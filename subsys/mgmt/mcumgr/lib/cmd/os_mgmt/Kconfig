config OS_MGMT_RESET_MS
	int "Delay before executing reset command (ms)"
	default 250
	depends on REBOOT
	help
	  When a reset command is received, the system waits this many milliseconds
	  before performing the reset.  This delay allows time for the mcumgr
	  response to be delivered.

config OS_MGMT_RESET_HOOK
	bool "Reset hook"
	depends on REBOOT
	help
	  Allows applications to control and get notifications of when a reset
	  command has been issued via an mcumgr command. With this option
	  disabled, modules will reboot when the command is received without
	  notification, when this is enabled and a handler is registered, the
	  application will be notified that a reset command has been received
	  and will allow the application to perform any required operations
	  before accepting or declining the reset request.

	default y
	help
	  Response will not include fields the Zephyr does not collect statistic for.
	  Enable this if your client software is able to process "taskstat" response
	  that would be missing "runtime", "cswcnt", "last_checkin" and "next_checkin"
	  map entries for each listed task.
	  Enabling this option will slightly reduce code size.

config OS_MGMT_TASKSTAT_MAX_NUM_THREADS
	int "Predicted maximum number of threads to return on taskstat list"
	default 50
	help
	  This is used for defining CBOR map holding thread info.
	  The value does not affect memory allocation, it is used by zcbor
	  to figure out how to encode map depending on its predicted size.

config OS_MGMT_TASKSTAT_THREAD_NAME_LEN
	int "Length of thread name to return in response"
	default THREAD_MAX_NAME_LEN if THREAD_NAME
	default 5 if !THREAD_NAME

	help
	  The length of the string that is sent in response to taskstat command,
	  as a thread name.
	  When THREAD_NAME is enabled then this defaults to THREAD_MAX_NAME_LEN.
	  When THREAD_NAME is disabled the name is generated from thread priority,
	  signed integer, and this number regulates how many digits will be used;
	  in such case this value should also take into account possible '-'
	  sign.

config OS_MGMT_TASKSTAT_SIGNED_PRIORITY
	bool "Signed priorities"
	default y
	help
	  Zephyr uses int8_t as thread priorities, but in taskstat response it encodes
	  them as unsigned.  Enabling this option will use signed int for priorities in
	  responses, which is more natural for Zephyr.
	  Disable this option if your client software is unable to properly decode and
	  accept signed integers as priorities.

config OS_MGMT_TASKSTAT_STACK_INFO
	bool "Include stack info in taskstat responses"
	depends on THREAD_STACK_INFO
	help
	  Enabling this option adds stack information into "taskstat" command
	  responses, this is default when THREAD_STACK_INFO is selected.
	  Disable this option only when your client application is able to
	  process "taskstat" response without the "stksiz" and "stkuse" fields.
	  It is worth disabling this option when THREAD_STACK_INFO is disabled,
	  as it will prevent sending zeroed stack information just to fill
	  all the fields in "taskstat" responses, and it will slightly reduce code size.
