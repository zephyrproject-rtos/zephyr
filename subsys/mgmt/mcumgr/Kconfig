	  This changes how "image" is understood by mcumgr: normally the mcumgr allows to upload
	  to first slot of the only image it knows, where image is understood as two slots
	  (two DTS images for Zephyr); this allows to treat every DTS defined image as direct
	  target for upload, and more than two may be used (4 at this time).
	  NOTE: When direct upload is used the image numbers are shifted by + 1, and the default
