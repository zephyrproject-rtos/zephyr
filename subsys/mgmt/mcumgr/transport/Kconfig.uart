	help
	  Enables handling of SMP commands received over UART.  This is a
	  lightweight alternative to MCUMGR_TRANSPORT_SHELL.  It allows mcumgr
	  commands to be received over UART without requiring an additional
	  thread.

menuconfig MCUMGR_TRANSPORT_UART_ASYNC
	bool "Use async UART API when available"
	help
	  The option enables use of UART async API when available for selected mcumgr uart port.

config MCUMGR_TRANSPORT_UART_ASYNC_BUFS
	int "Number of async RX UART buffers"
	range 2 8
	default 2
	help
	  The asynchronous UART API requires registering RX buffers for received data; when the RX
	  reaches the end of a buffer, it will send event requesting next buffer, to be able to
	  receive data without stopping due to running out of buffer space.  At least two buffers
	  area required for smooth RX operation.

config MCUMGR_TRANSPORT_UART_ASYNC_BUF_SIZE
	int "Size of single async RX UART buffer"
	default 64
	help
	  The size of single buffer for asynchronous RX.

	help
	  Maximum size of SMP frames sent and received over UART, in bytes.
	  This value must satisfy the following relation:
	  MCUMGR_TRANSPORT_UART_MTU <= MCUMGR_TRANSPORT_NETBUF_SIZE + 2

config MCUMGR_TRANSPORT_UART_RX_BUF_SIZE
	int "Size of receive buffer for mcumgr fragments received over UART, in bytes"
	default 128
	help
	  Specifies the size of the mcumgr UART receive buffer, in bytes. This
	  value must be large enough to accommodate any line sent by an mcumgr
	  client.

config MCUMGR_TRANSPORT_UART_RX_BUF_COUNT
	int "Number of receive buffers for mcumgr fragments received over UART"
	default 2
	help
	  Specifies the number of the mcumgr UART receive buffers.  Receive
	  buffers hold received mcumgr fragments prior to reassembly.  This
	  setting's value must satisfy the following relation:
	  MCUMGR_TRANSPORT_UART_RX_BUF_COUNT * MCUMGR_TRANSPORT_UART_RX_BUF_SIZE >=
