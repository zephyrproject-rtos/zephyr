	  Buffer size in bytes for TX buffer defined by the host command handler.
	  Some backend layers can define their own buffer, so the size can be zero to

	  Priority of the kernel task that handles the host commands.
	  If the priority is too low (high in value), the host commands handler may be unable to
	  process the command on time and the AP will abort the waiting for response and be unable
	  to boot the system properly.
