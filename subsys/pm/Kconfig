	bool
	help
	  This option must be selected by SoCs that provide PM hooks, that is,
	  calls to configure low-power states.

config PM
	bool "System Power Management"
	depends on SYS_CLOCK_EXISTS && HAS_PM
	help
	  This option enables the board to implement extra power management
	  policies whenever the kernel becomes idle. The kernel informs the
	  power management subsystem of the number of ticks until the next kernel
	  timer is due to expire.

	help
	  This option enables suspend-to-RAM (S2RAM).
	  When enabled on Cortex-M, and a 'zephyr,memory-region' compatible node with nodelabel
	  'pm_s2ram' is defined in DT, _cpu_context symbol (located in arch/arm/core/cortex_m/pm_s2ram.c)
	  is placed in linker section given by 'zephyr,memory-region' property of aforementioned node.

config PM_S2RAM_CUSTOM_MARKING
	bool "Use custom marking functions"
	depends on PM_S2RAM
	help
	  By default a magic word in RAM is used to mark entering suspend-to-RAM. Enabling
	  this option allows custom implementation of functions which handle the marking.

config PM_NEED_ALL_DEVICES_IDLE
	bool "System Low Power Mode Needs All Devices Idle"
	depends on PM_DEVICE && !SMP

	  When this option is enabled, check that no devices are busy before
	  entering into system low power mode.

	help
	  Exit latency for each power state is given in microseconds. It is converted
	  to ticks and system clock is set to wake up the core earlier before scheduled
	  wake up. This option specifies rounding that is used when converting exit
	  latency from microseconds to system ticks.

	help
	  This option enables the device power management interface.  The
	  interface implemented by device drivers are called by the power
	  management subsystem. This allows device drivers to do any
	  necessary power management operations like turning off
	  device clocks and peripherals. Device drivers may also save
	  and restore states in these hook functions.

	  domain is suspended or resumed.

	  The number of devices that can dynamically be bind to a Power Domain.

	  This option enables the system-managed device power
