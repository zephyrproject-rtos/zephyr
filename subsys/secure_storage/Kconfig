	help
	  The secure storage subsystem provides an implementation of the PSA Secure Storage API
	  functions on board targets that don't already have one.
	  It allows making use of the PSA Secure Storage API and persistent keys in the PSA Crypto
	  API in a standard and portable way.
	  It is configurable and different implementations can be used to accommodate the varying
	  capabilities of different devices.
	  In addition to providing functional support for the PSA Secure Storage API, depending on
	  the device-specific security features that are available and used, the subsystem may
	  secure the data stored through it at rest.
	  This is however highly dependent on the device and configuration in use, and not a
	  guarantee of the subsystem.
