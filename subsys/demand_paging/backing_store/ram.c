/*
 * TODO:
 *
 * This is a demonstration backing store for testing the kernel side of the
 * demand paging feature. In production there are basically two types of
 * backing stores:
 *
 * 1) A large, sparse backing store that is big enough to capture the entire
 *    address space. Implementation of these is very simple; the location
 *    token is just a function of the evicted virtual address and no space
 *    management is necessary. Clean copies of paged-in data pages may be kept
 *    indefinitely.
 *
 * 2) A backing store that has limited storage space, and is not sufficiently
 *    large to hold clean copies of all mapped memory.
 *
 * This backing store is an example of the latter case. However, locations
 * are freed as soon as pages are paged in, in
 * k_mem_paging_backing_store_page_finalize().
 * This implies that all data pages are treated as dirty as
 * K_MEM_PAGE_FRAME_BACKED is never set, even if the data page was paged out before
 * and not modified since then.
 *
 * An optimization a real backing store will want is have
 * k_mem_paging_backing_store_page_finalize() note the storage location of
 * a paged-in data page in a custom field of its associated k_mem_page_frame, and
 * set the K_MEM_PAGE_FRAME_BACKED bit. Invocations of
 * k_mem_paging_backing_store_location_get() will have logic to return
 * the previous clean page location instead of allocating
 * a new one if K_MEM_PAGE_FRAME_BACKED is set.
 *
 * This will, however, require the implementation of a clean page
 * eviction algorithm, to free backing store locations for loaded data pages
 * as the backing store fills up, and clear the K_MEM_PAGE_FRAME_BACKED bit
 * appropriately.
 *
 * All of this logic is local to the backing store implementation; from the
 * core kernel's perspective the only change is that K_MEM_PAGE_FRAME_BACKED
 * starts getting set for certain page frames after a page-in (and possibly
 * cleared at a later time).
