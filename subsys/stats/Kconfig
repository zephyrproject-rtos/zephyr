config STATS
	bool "Statistics support"
	help
	  Enable per-module event counters for troubleshooting, maintenance,
	  and usage monitoring.  Statistics can be retrieved with the mcumgr
	  management subsystem.

config STATS_NAMES
	bool "Statistic names"
	depends on STATS
	help
	  Include a full name string for each statistic in the build.  If this
	  setting is disabled, statistics are assigned generic names of the
	  form "s0", "s1", etc.  Enabling this setting simplifies debugging,
	  but results in a larger code size.

	depends on STATS && SHELL
	imply STATS_NAMES
	help
	  Include a full name string for each statistic in the build.  If this
