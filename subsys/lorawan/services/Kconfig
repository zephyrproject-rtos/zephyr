menuconfig LORAWAN_SERVICES

	depends on LORAWAN
	select ENTROPY_GENERATOR
	help
	  Enables the LoRaWAN background services, e.g. used for
	  firmware-upgrade over the air (FUOTA).

	  The services use a dedicated thread and a work queue.

config LORAWAN_SERVICES_THREAD_STACK_SIZE

	help
	  Stack size of thread running LoRaWAN background services.

config LORAWAN_SERVICES_THREAD_PRIORITY
	int "Services thread priority"
	default 2
	help
	  Priority of the thread running LoRaWAN background services.

config LORAWAN_APP_CLOCK_SYNC
	bool "Application Layer Clock Synchronization"
	help
	  Enables the LoRaWAN Application Layer Clock Synchronization service
	  according to LoRa Alliance TS003-2.0.0.

	  The service uses the default port 202.

	help
	  Initial setting for clock synchronization periodicity in seconds.

	  The value can be updated remotely by the application server within a
	  range from 128 (0x80) to 4194304 (0x400000).

	  Default setting: 24h.

	select FLASH_MAP
	select FLASH_PAGE_LAYOUT
	select IMG_MANAGER
	help
	  Enables the LoRaWAN Fragmented Data Block Transport service
	  according to TS004-1.0.0 as published by the LoRa Alliance.

	  The used default port for this service is 201.

choice LORAWAN_FRAG_TRANSPORT_DECODER

	  The default decoder implementation from LoRaMAC-node.

	help
	  Size of the flash partition for the application firmware image
	  in bytes.

	  The minimum number of fragments to be transferred is calculated from
	  this value divided by the fragment size.

	  This setting has significant influence on RAM usage.

	int "Maximum size of transported fragments"
	depends on LORAWAN_FRAG_TRANSPORT
	range 1 239
	default 232
	help
	  Maximum size of one fragment transferred during the fragmented data
	  block transport session of the FUOTA process. It is chosen on the
	  server side.

	  The fragment has to fit into the LoRaWAN payload, which can be up to
	  242 bytes depending on the region and frequency settings. 3 bytes of
	  the payload are consumed for protocol information.

	  For some MCUs like the STM32WL the fragment size has to be a multiple
	  of 8 (see flash driver for further information).

	  This setting has significant influence on RAM usage. If the exact
	  fragment size is known, use that value for MIN and MAX config to
	  reduce memory consumption.

config LORAWAN_FRAG_TRANSPORT_MIN_FRAG_SIZE
	int "Minimum size of transported fragments"
	depends on LORAWAN_FRAG_TRANSPORT
	range 1 239
	default 48
	help
	  Minimum size of one fragment transferred during the fragmented data
	  block transport session of the FUOTA process. It is chosen on the
	  server side.

	  The fragment has to fit into the LoRaWAN payload, which can be up to
	  242 bytes depending on the region and frequency settings. 3 bytes of

	default 20
	help
	  The built-in forward error correction (FEC) mechanism allows to
	  reconstruct missed packages from additional redundant packages
	  sent by the server after all packages have been sent.

	  This parameter specifies the maximum amount of packet loss (in
	  percent) for which it should be possible to reconstruct the full
	  firmware image.

	  This setting has significant influence on RAM usage.

config LORAWAN_REMOTE_MULTICAST
	bool "Remote Multicast Setup"
	depends on LORAWAN_APP_CLOCK_SYNC
	depends on !LORAWAN_NVM_NONE
	help
	  Enables the LoRaWAN Remote Multicast Setup service according to
	  TS005-1.0.0 as published by the LoRa Alliance.

	  The service is run automatically in the background. It is responsible
	  for multicast session key exchange and setting up a class C session.
	  The exchanged keys are stored in the non-volatile memory.

	  The used default port for this service is 200.
