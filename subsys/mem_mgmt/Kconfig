config MEM_ATTR
	bool "Memory Attributes management library"
	default y if ARM_MPU
	help
	  Enable a small library to manage the memory regions defined in the DT
	  with a `zephyr,memory-attr` property. This library builds at build
	  time an array of the memory regions defined in the DT that can be
	  probed at run-time using several helper functions. Set to `N` if
	  unsure to save RODATA space.

config MEM_ATTR_HEAP
	bool "Memory Attributes heap allocator"
	depends on MEM_ATTR
	help
	  Enable an heap allocator based on memory attributes to dynamically
	  allocate memory from DeviceTree defined memory regions.
