config RTIO_SUBMIT_SEM
	bool "Use a semaphore when waiting for completions in rtio_submit"
	default n if !MULTITHREADING
	default y
	help
	  When calling rtio_submit a semaphore is available to sleep the calling
	  thread for each completion queue event until the wait count is met. This
	  adds a small RAM overhead for a single semaphore. By default wait_for will
	  use polling on the completion queue with a k_yield() in between iterations.

	  Enabled by default unless !MULTITHREADING

config RTIO_CONSUME_SEM
	bool "Use a semaphore when waiting for completions in rtio_cqe_consume_block"
	default n if !MULTITHREADING
	default y
	help
	  When calling rtio_cqe_consume_block a semaphore is available to sleep the
	  calling thread for each completion queue event until the wait count is met.
	  This adds a small RAM overhead for a single semaphore. By default the call
	  will use polling on the completion queue with a k_yield() in between
	  iterations.

	  Enabled by default unless !MULTIHREADING

config RTIO_SYS_MEM_BLOCKS
	bool "Include system memory blocks as an optional backing read memory pool"
	select SYS_MEM_BLOCKS
	help
	  Enable the RTIO_DEFINE_WITH_MEMPOOL macro which allows queueing reads
	  without a pre-allocated memory buffer. Instead the buffer will be taken
	  from the allocated memory pool associated with the RTIO context.

config RTIO_OP_DELAY
	bool "Enable OP_DELAY"
	default y
	help
	  Enable OP_DELAY which allows for, in chains of operations, delaying using a
	  kernel timer. Note this makes the size of the submission queue entries
	  typically larger than a dcache line and may have performance implications.

config RTIO_SQE_CACHELINE_CHECK
	bool "Enable rtio_sqe cacheline sizing check"
	help
	  At build time check the size of struct rtio_sqe to ensure it is less than a
	  cache line otherwise the build will fail. This ensures high performance on
	  systems that are sensitive to data cache effects.
