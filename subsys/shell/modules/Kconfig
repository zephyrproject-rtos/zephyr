config KERNEL_SHELL_REBOOT_DELAY
	int "Delay between reception of shell reboot command and reboot (ms)"

	depends on REBOOT
	default 0
	help
	  This delay allows time for the shell to successfully echo the reboot

	  external systems that interact with the shell and require the reboot
	  command's echo to successfully complete to synchronise with the
	  device.

	bool "Device shell"
	default y if !SHELL_MINIMAL
	help
	  This shell provides access to basic device data.

config DATE_SHELL
