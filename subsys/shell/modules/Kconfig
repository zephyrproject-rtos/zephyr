config ZYCLICTEST_SHELL

	  This shell command provides latency measurement.
	  Measure latencies of interrupt service routines and threads when
	  woken up by a timer. Collecting data in the background while
	  application of interrest is running in the foreground.
	  It can be switched on by demand and measure the worst case latencies
	  with the exact circumstances of the productive application. Thus one
	  can see if for example interrupts or preemption locks are preventing
	  the application to run.
	  Inspired by Linux cyclictest tool.
