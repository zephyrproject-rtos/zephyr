	  This delay allows time for the shell to successfully echo the reboot
	  command input before the reboot abruptly terminates it. This can help
	  external systems that interact with the shell and require the reboot
	  command's echo to successfully complete to synchronise with the
	  device.

	  Whether a fatal error handler is installed or not, it may come in
	  handy to have a way to generate a kernel panic as if something had
	  crashed, but reliably through the shell.
