	int "Default log level"
	default 3
	range 0 4
	help
	  Sets log level for modules which don't specify it explicitly. When
	  set to 0 it means log will not be activated for those modules.
	  Levels are:

	  - 0 OFF, do not write by default
	  - 1 ERROR, default to only write LOG_LEVEL_ERR
	  - 2 WARNING, default to write LOG_LEVEL_WRN
	  - 3 INFO, default to write LOG_LEVEL_INFO
	  - 4 DEBUG, default to write LOG_LEVEL_DBG

config LOG_OVERRIDE_LEVEL
	int "Override lowest log level"
	default 0
	range 0 4
	help
	  Forces a minimum log level for all modules. Modules use their
	  specified level if it is greater than this option, otherwise they use
	  the level specified by this option instead of their default or
	  whatever was manually set.
	  Levels are:

	  - 0 OFF, do not override
	  - 1 ERROR, override to write LOG_LEVEL_ERR
	  - 2 WARNING, override to write LOG_LEVEL_WRN
	  - 3 INFO, override to write LOG_LEVEL_INFO
	  - 4 DEBUG, override to write LOG_LEVEL_DBG

config LOG_MAX_LEVEL
	int "Maximal log level compiled in the system"
	default 4
	range 0 4
	help
	  Forces a maximal log level for all modules. Modules saturates their
	  specified level if it is greater than this option, otherwise they use
	  the level specified by this option instead of their default or
	  whatever was manually set.
	  Levels are:

	  - 0 OFF, logging is turned off
	  - 1 ERROR, maximal level set to LOG_LEVEL_ERR
	  - 2 WARNING, maximal level set to LOG_LEVEL_WRN
