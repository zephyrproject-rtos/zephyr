	depends on SYS_LOG
	default 0

	help
	  Sets log level for modules which don't specify it explicitly. When

	default 256
	help
	  As each syslog message needs to fit to UDP packet, set this value
	  so that messages are not truncated.
	  The RFC 5426 recommends that for IPv4 the size is 480 octets and for
	  IPv6 the size is 1180 octets. As each buffer will use RAM, the value
	  should be selected so that typical messages will fit the buffer.
	  The total allocated memory will be
	  SYS_LOG_BACKEND_NET_MAX_BUF * SYS_LOG_BACKEND_NET_MAX_BUF_SIZE

	  When enabled log is processed in the context of the call. It impacts
