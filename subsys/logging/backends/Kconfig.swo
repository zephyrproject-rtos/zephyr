	  Set SWO output frequency. Value 0 will select maximum frequency
	  supported by the given MCU. Not all debug probes support high
	  frequency SWO operation. In this case the frequency has to be set
	  manually.

	  SWO value defined by this option will be configured at boot. Most SWO
	  viewer programs will configure SWO frequency when attached to the
	  debug probe. Such configuration will persist only until the device
	  reset. To ensure flawless operation the frequency configured here and
	  by the SWO viewer program has to match.
