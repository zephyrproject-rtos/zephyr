	help
	  The code coverage report generation is only available on boards
	  with enough spare RAM to buffer the coverage data, or on boards
	  based on the POSIX ARCH.

	help
	  This option will build your application with the -coverage option
	  which will generate data that can be used to create coverage reports.

	  Build natively with the compiler standard `--coverage` options,

	  Build natively with the compiler source based coverage options.
	  Today this is only supported with LLVM

config COVERAGE_GCOV

	depends on !NATIVE_BUILD
	help
	  This option will select the custom gcov library. The reports will
	  be available over serial. This serial dump can be passed to
	  gen_gcov_files.py which creates the required .gcda files. These
	  can be read by gcov utility. For more details see gcovr.com .

	help
	  This option configures the heap size allocated for gcov coverage
	  data to be dumped over serial. If the value is 0, no buffer will be used,
	  data will be dumped directly over serial.

	help
	  Regardless of platform support, it will enable coverage data production.
	  If the platform does not support coverage by default, setting this config
	  does not guarantee that coverage data will be gathered.
	  Application may not fit memory or crash at runtime.

config COVERAGE_DUMP_PATH_EXCLUDE
	string "Exclude files matching this pattern from the coverage data"
	default ""
	help
	  Filenames are matched against the pattern using the POSIX fnmatch
	  function. Filenames are based on their path in the build folder, not the
	  original source tree. The empty string "" disables the pattern
	  matching.
