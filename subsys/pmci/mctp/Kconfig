config MCTP_HEAP_SIZE
	int "MCTP Heap Size"
	default 1024
	help
	  MCTP requires a heap for allocating packet buffers. A dedicated
	  heap is provided to MCTP at startup avoiding the need to specify
	  libmctp's allocation operations. This setting defines the size of
	  the dedicated MCTP heap in bytes. Defaults to 1KB for small packets.

config MCTP_UART
	bool "MCTP UART Binding"
	depends on UART_ASYNC_API
	help
	  Build the MCTP UART binding to use MCTP over Zephyr's async UART
	  interface.

config MCTP_I2C_GPIO_CONTROLLER
	bool "MCTP I2C+GPIO Controller Binding"
	depends on I2C
	depends on I2C_RTIO
	depends on GPIO
	help
	  Build the MCTP I2C+GPIO controller binding to use MCTP over Zephyr's I2C RTIO
	  interface and GPIO interrupts from targets to signal their request to write.

config MCTP_I2C_GPIO_TARGET
	bool "MCTP I2C+GPIO Target Binding"
	depends on I2C
	depends on GPIO
	help
	  Build the MCTP I2C+GPIO target binding to use MCTP over Zephyr's I2C target
	  interface and GPIO to signal writes to the bus controller.
