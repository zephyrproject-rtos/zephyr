config TEST_RANDOM_GENERATOR
	bool "Allow non-random number generator"
	help
	  This option signifies that a non-random number generator is allowed to
	  be used and the kernel's random number APIs are permitted to return
	  values that are not truly random.

	  This capability is provided for testing purposes when a truly random
	  number generator is not available. The non-random number generator
	  should not be used in a production environment.

	  This option is intended to be selected only by application-level
	  configurations (e.g. in tests and samples) to indicate that the
	  application is allowed to run with a random number generator that is not
	  truly random. Board-level configurations must not select this option
	  unless the sole purpose of the board is testing (e.g. QEMU emulation
	  boards).

	  Note that this option does not imply that a non-random number generator
	  is selected -- that is indicated by RNG_GENERATOR_CHOICE. An entropy
	  device-backed random number generator, if available, will be selected by
	  default even when CONFIG_TEST_RANDOM_GENERATOR=y.

	  Platform dependent non-cryptographically secure random number support.

	  If the entropy support of the platform has sufficient performance
	  to support random request then select that. Otherwise, select the
	  XOSHIRO algorithm

config TIMER_RANDOM_GENERATOR
	bool "System timer clock based number generator"
	depends on TEST_RANDOM_GENERATOR
	help
	  This options enables number generator based on system timer
	  clock. This number generator is not random and used for
	  testing only.

config ENTROPY_DEVICE_RANDOM_GENERATOR
	bool "Use entropy driver to generate random numbers"
	depends on ENTROPY_HAS_DRIVER
	help
	  Enables a random number generator that uses the enabled hardware
	  entropy gathering driver to generate random numbers. Should only be
	  selected if hardware entropy driver is designed to be a random
	  number generator source.

config XOROSHIRO_RANDOM_GENERATOR
	bool "Use Xoroshiro128+ as PRNG (DEPRECATED)"
	help
	  This is deprecated, please use XOSHIRO_RANDOM_GENERATOR instead.

config XOSHIRO_RANDOM_GENERATOR
	bool "Use Xoshiro128++ as PRNG"
	depends on ENTROPY_HAS_DRIVER
	help
	  Enables the Xoshiro128++ pseudo-random number generator, that uses
	  the entropy driver as a seed source. This is a fast general-purpose
	  non-cryptographically secure random number generator.
