 * @brief SIRK encryption function sef

 * If the pairing was performed on BR/EDR, K is equal to the Link Key shared by
 * the server and the client.
 *    K = Link Key.
 *
 * If the pairing was performed on LE, the 64 LSBs of K correspond to the 64
 * LSBs of the IRK that the server sent to the client during the Phase 3
 * (Transport Specific Key Distribution) of the pairing procedure (see Volume 3,
 * Part H, Section 2.1 in [2]), and the 64 MSBs of K correspond to the 64 MSBs
