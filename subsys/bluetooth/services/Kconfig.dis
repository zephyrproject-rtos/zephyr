	  The Vendor ID Source field designates which organization assigned the
	  value used in the Vendor ID field value.
	  The possible values are:
	  - 1 Bluetooth SIG, the Vendor ID was assigned by the Bluetooth SIG
	  - 2 USB IF, the Vendor ID was assigned by the USB IF

	help
	  The Vendor ID field is intended to uniquely identify the vendor of the
	  device. This field is used in conjunction with Vendor ID Source field,
	  which determines which organization assigned the Vendor ID field value.
	  Note: The Bluetooth Special Interest Group assigns Device ID Vendor ID,
	  and the USB Implementers Forum assigns Vendor IDs,
	  either of which can be used for the Vendor ID field value.
	  Device providers should procure the Vendor ID from the USB Implementers
	  Forum or the Company Identifier from the Bluetooth SIG.

config BT_DIS_PNP_PID
	hex "Product ID"
	range 0 0xFFFF

	help
	  The Product ID field is intended to distinguish between different products
	  made by the vendor identified with the Vendor ID field. The vendors
	  themselves manage Product ID field values.

config BT_DIS_PNP_VER
	hex "Product Version"
	range 0 0xFFFF
	default 1
	help
	  The Product Version field is a numeric expression identifying the device
	  release number in Binary-Coded Decimal. This is a vendor-assigned value,
	  which defines the version of the product identified by the Vendor ID and
	  Product ID fields. This field is intended to differentiate between
	  versions of products with identical Vendor IDs and Product IDs.
	  The value of the field value is 0xJJMN for version JJ.M.N
	  (JJ - major version number, M - minor version number,
	  N - sub-minor version number); e.g., version 2.1.3 is represented with
	  value 0x0213 and version 2.0.0 is represented with a value of 0x0200.
	  When upward-compatible changes are made to the device, it is recommended
	  that the minor version number be incremented. If incompatible changes are
	  made to the device, it is recommended that the major version number be
	  incremented. The sub-minor version is incremented for bug fixes.
