	  The Vendor ID field is intended to uniquely identify the vendor of the

	  which determines which organization assigned the Vendor ID field value.
	  Note: The Bluetooth Special Interest Group assigns Device ID Vendor ID,
	  and the USB Implementers Forum assigns Vendor IDs,
	  either of which can be used for the Vendor ID field value.

	  The Product Version field is a numeric expression identifying the device
	  release number in Binary-Coded Decimal. This is a vendor-assigned value,
	  which defines the version of the product identified by the Vendor ID and
	  Product ID fields. This field is intended to differentiate between
	  versions of products with identical Vendor IDs and Product IDs.
	  The value of the field value is 0xJJMN for version JJ.M.N
	  (JJ - major version number, M - minor version number,
	  N - sub-minor version number); e.g., version 2.1.3 is represented with
	  value 0x0213 and version 2.0.0 is represented with a value of 0x0200.
	  When upward-compatible changes are made to the device, it is recommended
	  that the minor version number be incremented. If incompatible changes are
	  made to the device, it is recommended that the major version number be
	  incremented. The sub-minor version is incremented for bug fixes.
