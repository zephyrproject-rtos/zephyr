	  Maximum number of simultaneous Bluetooth isochronous channels

config BT_ISO_TX_BUF_COUNT
	int "Number of Isochronous TX buffers"

	  Number of buffers available for outgoing Isochronous channel SDUs.

config BT_ISO_TX_FRAG_COUNT
	int "Number of ISO TX fragment buffers"
	default 2
	range 0 255
	help
	  Number of buffers available for fragments of TX buffers. Warning:
	  setting this to 0 means that the application must ensure that
	  queued TX buffers never need to be fragmented, i.e. that the
	  controller's buffer size is large enough. If this is not ensured,
	  and there are no dedicated fragment buffers, a deadlock may occur.
	  In most cases the default value of 2 is a safe bet.

config BT_ISO_TX_MTU
	int "Maximum supported MTU for Isochronous TX buffers"

	  Maximum MTU for Isochronous channels TX buffers.
	  This is the actual data payload. It doesn't include the optional
	  HCI ISO Data packet fields (e.g. `struct bt_hci_iso_sdu_ts_hdr`).
	  Set this value to 247 to fit 247 bytes of data within a single
	  HCI ISO Data packet with Data_Total_Length of 255, utilizing
	  timestamps.

config BT_ISO_RX_BUF_COUNT
	int "Number of Isochronous RX buffers"
	default 1
	range 1 255

	  Number of buffers available for incoming Isochronous channel SDUs.

config BT_ISO_TEST_PARAMS
	bool "ISO test parameters support"
	help
	  Enabling advanced ISO parameters will allow the use of the ISO test
	  parameters for creating a CIG or a BIG. These test parameters were
	  intended for testing, but can be used to allow the host to set more
	  settings that are otherwise usually controlled by the controller.

	  Maximum number of CIGs that are supported by the host. A CIG can be
	  used for either transmitting or receiving.
