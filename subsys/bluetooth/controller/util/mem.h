/**
 * @brief Round up to nearest multiple of 4, for unsigned integers
 * @details
 *   The addition of 3 forces x into the next multiple of 4. This is responsible
 *   for the rounding in the next step, to be Up.
 *   For ANDing of ~3: We observe y & (~3) == (y>>2)<<2, and we recognize
 *   (y>>2) as a floored division, which is almost undone by the left-shift. The
 *   flooring can't be undone so have achieved a rounding.
 *
 *   Examples:
 *    MROUND( 0) =  0
 *    MROUND( 1) =  4
 *    MROUND( 2) =  4
 *    MROUND( 3) =  4
 *    MROUND( 4) =  4
 *    MROUND( 5) =  8
 *    MROUND( 8) =  8
 *    MROUND( 9) = 12
 *    MROUND(13) = 16
