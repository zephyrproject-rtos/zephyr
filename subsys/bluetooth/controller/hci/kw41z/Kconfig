config KW41_ADVERTISING_DEFAULT_TX_POWER
	int "Advertising default TX power"
	default 20
	help
	  Default Tx Power on the advertising channel.
	  For MKW41Z BLE controller there are 32 possible power
	  levels 0 <= N <= 31 for which the output power is distributed
	  evenly between minimum and maximum power levels.
	  For further details see the silicon datasheet.

config KW41_CONNECTION_DEFAULT_TX_POWER
	int "Connection default TX power"
	default 20
	help
	  Default Tx Power on the connection channel.
	  For MKW41Z BLE controller there are 32 possible power
	  levels 0 <= N <= 31 for which the output power is distributed
	  evenly between minimum and maximum power levels.
	  For further details see the silicon datasheet.

	  Offset to the first instant register. Units in 625uS time slots.

	  Ex. If current clock value is 0x0004 and offset is 0x0008, then
	  the first event will begin when clock value becomes 0x000C.

	  A value of 0xFFFF will be ignored and default value (0x0006)
	  will be set.
