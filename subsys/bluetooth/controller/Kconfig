config BLUETOOTH_CONTROLLER_XTAL_ADVANCED
	bool "Advanced event preparation"
	default y
	help
	  Enables advanced event preparation offset ahead of radio tx/rx, taking
	  into account predictive processing time requirements in preparation to
	  the event, like control procedure handling and CPU execution speeds.
	  Crystal oscillator is retained between closely spaced consecutive
	  radio events to reduce the overall number of crystal settling current
	  consumptions.

	  This feature maximizes radio utilization in an average role event
	  timeslice when they are closely spaced by using a reduced offset
	  between preparation and radio event.

	  By disabling this feature, the controller will use a constant offset
	  between the preparation and radio event. The controller will toggle
	  crystal oscillator between two closely spaced radio events leading to
	  higher average current due to increased number of crystal settling
	  current consumptions.

config BLUETOOTH_CONTROLLER_XTAL_THRESHOLD

	help
	  Configure the optimal delta in micro seconds between two consecutive

	help
	  Enable non-overlapping placement of observer, initiator and master
	  roles in timespace. Uses window offset in connection updates and uses
	  connection parameter request in slave role to negotiate
	  non-overlapping placement with active master roles to avoid slave
	  roles drifting into active master roles in the local controller.

	  This feature maximizes the average data transmission amongst active
	  concurrent master and slave connections while other observer,
	  initiator, master or slave roles are active in the local controller.

	  Disabling this feature will lead to overlapping role in timespace
	  leading to skipped events amongst active roles.

	  Enable use of hardware accelerated tIFS Trx switching.

	  Peripheral will respond to Encryption Request with Encryption Response
	  in the same connection interval, and also, will respond with Start
	  Encryption Response PDU in the 3rd connection interval, hence
	  completing encryption setup in 3 connection intervals. Encrypted data
	  would be transmitted as fast as in 3rd connection interval from the
	  connection establishment.
	  Maximum CPU time in Radio ISR will increase if this feature is
	  selected.
