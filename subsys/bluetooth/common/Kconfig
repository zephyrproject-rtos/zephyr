	help
	  Maximum supported ACL size of data packets sent from the Host to the
	  Controller. This value does not include the HCI ACL header.
	  The Host will segment the data transmitted to the Controller so that
	  packets sent to the Controller will contain data up to this size.
	  In a combined build this value will be set in both the Host and the
	  Controller.
	  In a Host-only build the Host will read the maximum ACL size supported
	  by the Controller and use the smallest value supported by both the
	  Host and the Controller.
	  The Host supports sending of larger L2CAP PDUs than the ACL size and
	  will fragment L2CAP PDUs into ACL data packets.
	  The Controller will return this value in the HCI LE Read Buffer
	  Size command response. If this size if greater than effective Link
	  Layer transmission size then the Controller will perform
	  fragmentation before transmitting the packet(s) on air.
	  If this value is less than the effective Link Layer transmission size
	  then this will restrict the maximum Link Layer transmission size.

	  Number of outgoing ACL data buffers sent from the Host to the
	  Controller. This determines the maximum amount of data packets the
	  Host can have queued in the Controller before waiting for the
	  to notify the Host that more packets can be queued with the Number of
	  Completed Packets event.
	  The buffers are shared between all of the connections and the Host
	  determines how to divide the buffers between the connections.
	  The Controller will return this value in the HCI LE Read Buffer Size
	  command response.

	help
	  Maximum support ACL size of data packets sent from the Controller to
	  the Host. This value does not include the HCI ACL header.
	  In a combined Host and Controller build the buffer sizes in both the
	  Host and the Controller will use this value for buffer sizes, and
	  therefore Controller to Host flow Controller is not needed.
	  In a Host only build with Controller to Host flow control enabled
	  the Host will inform the Controller about the maximum ACL data size it
	  can send by setting this value in the Host Buffer Size command.
	  If Controller to Host flow control is not enabled then the Controller
	  can assume the Host has infinite buffer size so this value should then
	  be set to something that is guaranteed the Controller will not exceed
	  or the data packets will be dropped.
	  In a Controller only build this will determine the maximum ACL size
	  that the Controller will send to the Host.
	  The Host supports reassembling of L2CAP PDUs from ACL data packets,
	  but the maximum supported L2CAP PDU size is limited by the maximum
	  supported ACL size.
	  This means the maximum L2CAP PDU MTU is restricted by the maximum ACL
	  size subtracting the 4 byte header of an L2CAP PDU.
	  When using L2CAP Connection oriented Channels without segmentation
	  then the L2CAP SDU MTU is also restricted by the maximum ACL size
	  subtracting the 4 Byte header of an L2CAP PDU plus the 2 byte header
	  of an L2CAP SDU.

	  With Enhanced ATT enabled the minimum of 70 is needed to support the
	  minimum ATT_MTU of 64 octets in an L2CAP SDU without segmentation.
	  With SMP LE Secure Connections enabled the minimum of 69 is needed to
	  support the minimum SMP MTU of 65 octets (public key + opcode) in an
	  L2CAP PDU.

	  An L2CAP PDU is also referred to as an L2CAP basic frame or B-frame.
	  An L2CAP SDU is also referred to as an L2CAP Credit-based frame or
	  K-frame.
