	  In a combined build this value will be set in both the Host and the
	  Controller.

	  In a Host-only build the Host will read the maximum ACL size supported
	  by the Controller and use the smallest value supported by both the
	  Host and the Controller.

	  The Host supports sending of larger L2CAP PDUs than the ACL size and
	  will fragment L2CAP PDUs into ACL data packets.
	  The Controller will return this value in the HCI LE Read Buffer
	  Size command response. If this size if greater than effective Link
	  Layer transmission size then the Controller will perform
	  fragmentation before transmitting the packet(s) on air.
	  If this value is less than the effective Link Layer transmission size
	  then this will restrict the maximum Link Layer transmission size.

	  Maximum support ACL size of data packets sent from the Controller to
	  the Host. This value does not include the HCI ACL header.

	  In a combined Host and Controller build, both the
	  Host and the Controller will use this value for buffer sizes, making
	  Controller to Host flow control not strictly necessary.

	  In a Host only build with Controller to Host flow control enabled
	  the Host will inform the Controller about the maximum ACL data size it
	  can send by setting this value in the Host Buffer Size command.

	  If Controller to Host flow control is not enabled then the Controller
	  can assume the Host has to receive and process ACL data faster than
	  the controller can produce it.

	  In a Controller only build this will determine the maximum ACL size
	  that the Controller will send to the Host.

	  CONFIG_BT_MAX_CONN + 1, to support L2CAP recombination.

	  The L2CAP recombination in the Host keeps the first Rx buffer for each
	  connection and uses one Rx buffer across all connections to receive a
	  fragment from the Controller.

config BT_BUF_ACL_RX_COUNT

	  In a Host only build with Controller to Host flow control enabled
	  the Host will inform the Controller about the maximum number of
	  buffers by setting this value in the Host Buffer Size command.

	  When Controller to Host flow control is not enabled the Controller
	  can assume that the Host has infinite amount of buffers.

	  For both configurations, there is an additional requirement that is
	  enforced by a build-time check: BT_BUF_ACL_RX_COUNT needs to be at

	  Number of buffers available for outgoing HCI commands from the Host.

	  HCI Controllers may not support Num_HCI_Command_Packets > 1, hence they default to 1 when
	  not enabling Controller to Host data flow control (BT_HCI_ACL_FLOW_CONTROL), Read Remote
	  Version Information (BT_REMOTE_VERSION), Auto-Initiate PHY update (BT_AUTO_PHY_UPDATE), or
	  Auto-Initiate Data Length Update (BT_AUTO_DATA_LEN_UPDATE).

	  Normal HCI commands follow the HCI command flow control using Num_HCI_Command_Packets
	  return in HCI command complete and status.

	  The Host Number of Completed Packets command does not follow normal flow control of HCI
	  commands and the Controller side HCI drivers that allocates HCI command buffers with
	  K_NO_WAIT can end up running out of command buffers.

	  When Controller to Host data flow control is enabled in the Host-only or combined
	  Host plus Controller build, the internal BT_BUF_CMD_TX_COUNT is adjusted accordingly
	  taking into considerations the enabled auto-initiated procedures, and to follow the normal
	  HCI command flow control to be able to send Ncmd normal HCI commands and
	  BT_BUF_ACL_RX_COUNT of Host Number of Completed Packets command down to the Controller.

	  When Controller to Host data flow control is supported in the Controller-only build,
	  the internal BT_BUF_CMD_TX_COUNT is adjusted to be equal to (BT_BUF_RX_COUNT + Ncmd).

	  Where Ncmd is supported maximum Num_HCI_Command_Packets in the Controller implementation.
