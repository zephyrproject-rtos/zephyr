	  advertiser is only possible if the controller also supports privacy.

config BT_PRIVACY_RANDOMIZE_IR
	bool "Randomize identity root for fallback identities"
	depends on BT_PRIVACY
	select BT_SETTINGS
	help
	  Enabling this option will cause the Host to ignore controller-provided
	  identity roots (IR). The Host will instead use bt_rand to generate
	  identity resolving keys (IRK) and store them in the settings subsystem.

	  Setting this config may come with a performance penalty to boot time,
	  as the hardware RNG may need time to generate entropy and will block
	  Bluetooth initialization.

	  This option increases privacy, as explained in the following text.

	  The IR determines the IRK of the identity. The IRK is used to both
	  generate and resolve (recognize) the private addresses of an identity.
	  The IRK is a shared secret, distributed to peers bonded to that
	  identity.

	  An attacker that has stolen or once bonded and retained the IRK can
	  forever resolve addresses from that IRK, even if that bond has been
	  deleted locally.

	  Deleting an identity should ideally delete the IRK as well and thereby
	  restore anonymity from previously bonded peers. But unless this config
	  is set, this does not always happen.

	  In particular, a factory reset function that wipes the data in the
	  settings subsystem may not affect the controller-provided IRs. If
	  those IRs are reused, this device can be tracked across factory resets.

	  For optimal privacy, a new IRK (i.e., identity) should be used per
	  bond. However, this naturally limits advertisements from that identity
	  to be recognizable by only that one bonded device.

	  A description of the exact effect of this setting follows.

	  If the application has not setup an identity before calling
	  settings_load()/settings_load_subtree("bt") after bt_enable(), the
	  Host will automatically try to load saved identities from the settings
	  subsystem, and if there are none, set up the default identity
	  (BT_ID_DEFAULT).

	  If the controller has a public address (HCI_Read_BD_ADDR), that becomes
	  the address of the default identity. The Host will by default try to
	  obtain the IR for that identity from the controller (by Zephyr HCI
	  Read_Key_Hierarchy_Roots). Setting this config randomizes the IR
	  instead.

	  If the controller does not have a public address, the Host will try
	  to source the default identity from the static address information
	  from controller (Zephyr HCI Read_Static_Addresses). This results in an
	  identity for each entry in Read_Static_Addresses. Setting this config
	  randomizes the IRs during this process.

	  Important: If this option is not enabled, the current implementation
	  will automatically fail the bonding. See "RL limitation" below.

	  Important: If this option is not enabled, as Peripheral, it may be too
	  late to abort the bonding. The pairing is failed locally, but it may
	  still be reported as successful on the Central. When this situation
	  occurs, the Zephyr Peripheral will immediately disconnect. See "SMP
	  limitation" below.

	  [RL limitation]:
	  The Host implementers have considered it unlikely that applications
	  would ever want to have multiple bonds with the same peer. The
	  implementers prioritize the simplicity of the implementation over this
	  capability.

	  The Resolve List on a Controller is not able to accommodate multiple
	  local addresses/IRKs for a single remote address. This would prevent
	  the Host from setting up a one-to-one correspondence between the Host
	  bond database and the Controller Resolve List. The implementation
	  relies on that capability when using the Resolve List. For performance
	  reasons, there is the wish to not fallback to Host Address Resolution
	  in this case.

	  [SMP Limitation]:
	  The Paring Failed command of the Security Manager Protocol cannot be
	  sent outside of a Pairing Process. A Pairing Process ends when the
	  last Transport Specific Key to be distributed is acknowledged at
	  link-layer. The Host does not have control over this acknowledgment,
