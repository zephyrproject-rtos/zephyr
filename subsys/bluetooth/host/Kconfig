	  Use a custom logging protocol over the console UART
	  instead of plain-text output. Requires a special application
	  on the host side that can decode this protocol. Currently
	  the 'btmon' tool from BlueZ is capable of doing this.

	  If the target board has two or more external UARTs it is
	  possible to keep using UART_CONSOLE together with this option,
	  however if there is only a single external UART then
	  UART_CONSOLE needs to be disabled (in which case printk/printf
	  will get encoded into the monitor protocol).
