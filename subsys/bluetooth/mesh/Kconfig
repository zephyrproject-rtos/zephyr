	  additional upper limit of 144 hours).

	  In order to fulfill the above requirement, even if the node might
	  be powered off once in a while, we need to store persistently
	  how many hours the node has been in the state. This doesn't
	  necessarily need to happen every hour (thanks to the flexible
