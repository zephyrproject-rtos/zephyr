	  This value defines how often the local sequence number gets

	  means that the sequence number will be stored to flash on every
	  100th increment. If the node sends messages very frequently a
	  higher value makes more sense, whereas if the node sends
	  infrequently a value as low as 0 (update storage for every
	  increment) can make sense. When the stack gets initialized it
	  will add this number to the last stored one, so that it starts

	  This value defines time in seconds until unsaved RPL and SRPL entries
	  are written to the persistent storage. Setting this value
	  to a large number may lead to security vulnerabilities if a node
	  gets powered off before the timer is fired. When flash is used
	  as the persistent storage setting this value to a low number
	  may wear out flash sooner or later. However, if the RPL gets
	  updated infrequently a value as low as 0 (write immediately)
	  may make sense. Setting this value to -1 will disable this timer.
	  In this case, a user is responsible to store pending RPL entries
	  using @ref bt_mesh_rpl_pending_store. In the mean time, when
	  IV Index is updated, the outdated RPL entries will still be
	  stored by @ref BT_MESH_STORE_TIMEOUT. Finding the right balance
	  between this timeout and calling @ref bt_mesh_rpl_pending_store
	  may reduce a risk of security vulnerability and flash wear out.
	  Failure to store the RPL and becoming vulnerable after reboot
