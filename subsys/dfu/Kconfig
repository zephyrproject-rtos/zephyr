	default MCUBOOT_IMG_MANAGER
	help
	  Choice support for managing DFU image.
	  So far only mcuboot support is available.

config MCUBOOT_IMG_MANAGER

config MCUBOOT_SHELL
	bool "MCUboot shell"
	depends on SHELL
	help
	  Enable shell module, which provides information about image slots and
	  allows to perform such operations as: confirm, erase and request
	  upgrade.

config MCUBOOT_TRAILER_SWAP_TYPE
	bool "use trailer's swap_type field"
	default y
	help
	  Enables usage swap type field which is required after
	  "Fix double swap on interrupted revert"  mcuboot patch
	  (https://github.com/JuulLabs-OSS/mcuboot/pull/485)
	  Disable this option if need to be compatible with earlier version
	  of MCUBoot.

config MCUBOOT_UPDATE_FOOTER_SIZE
	hex "Estimated update footer size"
	default 0x0
	help
	  Estimated size of update image data, which is used to prevent loading of firmware updates
	  that MCUboot cannot update due to being too large. This should be set from sysbuild, only
	  used when MCUMGR_GRP_IMG_TOO_LARGE_SYSBUILD is enabled.

config IMG_BLOCK_BUF_SIZE
	int "Image writer buffer size"
	default 512
	help
	  Size (in Bytes) of buffer for image writer. Must be a multiple of
	  the access alignment required by used flash driver.

config IMG_ERASE_PROGRESSIVELY
	bool "Erase flash progressively when receiving new firmware"
	select STREAM_FLASH_ERASE
	depends on FLASH_HAS_EXPLICIT_ERASE
	help
	  If enabled, flash is erased as necessary when receiving new firmware,
	  instead of erasing the whole image slot at once. This is necessary
	  on some hardware that has long erase times, to prevent long wait
	  times at the beginning of the DFU process.

config IMG_ENABLE_IMAGE_CHECK
	bool "Image check functions"
	select FLASH_AREA_CHECK_INTEGRITY
	help
	  If enabled, there will be available the function to check flash
	  integrity.  It can be used to verify flash integrity after received
	  a new firmware.  This is useful to avoid firmware reboot and test.
	  Another use is to ensure that firmware upgrade routines from internet
	  server to flash slot are performing properly.
