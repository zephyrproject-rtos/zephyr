config IMG_ERASE_PROGRESSIVELY
	bool "Erase flash progressively when receiving new firmware"
	depends on MCUBOOT_IMG_MANAGER
	select STREAM_FLASH_ERASE
	help
	  If enabled, flash is erased as necessary when receiving new firmware,
	  instead of erasing the whole image slot at once. This is necessary
	  on some hardware that has long erase times, to prevent long wait
	  times at the beginning of the DFU process.

config IMG_ENABLE_IMAGE_CHECK
	bool "Enable image check functions"
	depends on MCUBOOT_IMG_MANAGER
	select FLASH_AREA_CHECK_INTEGRITY
	help
	  If enabled, there will be available the function to check flash
	  integrity.  It can be used to verify flash integrity after received
	  a new firmware.  This is useful to avoid firmware reboot and test.
	  Another use is to ensure that firmware upgrade routines from internet
	  server to flash slot are performing properly.
