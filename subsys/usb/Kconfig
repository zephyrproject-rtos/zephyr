	  This option provides a dedicated work queue that is used for

	  This prevents deadlock situations where tasks on the system
	  workqueue inadvertently initiate operations that block, such
	  as UART transmission on CDC-ACM, preventing the system work
	  queue from making progress on the USB tasks that would
	  release the task.

	  By default, USB work queue priority is the lowest cooperative
	  priority. This means that any work handler, once started, won't
	  be preempted by any other thread until finished.
