	  is aborted.

config ISOTP_REQUIRE_RX_PADDING
	bool "Require padding for received messages"
	help
	  If enabled, SFs, FCs and the last CF must always have a DLC of 8 bytes
	  (for classic CAN) and unused bytes must be padded by the sending
	  device. This setting allows to be compliant to AUTOSAR Specification
	  of CAN Transport Layer.

	  By default, received CAN frames with or without padding are accepted.

config ISOTP_ENABLE_TX_PADDING
	bool "Padding for transmitted messages"
	default y if ISOTP_REQUIRE_RX_PADDING
	help
	  Add padding bytes 0xCC (as recommended by Bosch) if the PDU payload
	  does not fit exactly into the CAN frame.

	int "Number of data buffers for receiving data"
	default 4

config ISOTP_RX_BUF_SIZE
	int "Size of one buffer data block"
	default 63 if CAN_FD_MODE
	default 56
	help
	  This value defines the size of a single block in the pool. The number of
	  blocks is given by ISOTP_RX_BUF_COUNT. To be efficient use a multiple of
	  CAN_MAX_DLEN - 1 (for classic CAN : 8 - 1 = 7, for CAN FD : 64 - 1 = 63).

config ISOTP_RX_SF_FF_BUF_COUNT
	int "Number of SF and FF data buffers for receiving data"
	default 4
	help
	  This buffer is used for first and single frames. It is extra because the
	  buffer has to be ready for the first reception in isr context and therefor
	  is allocated when binding.
	  Each buffer will occupy CAN_MAX_DLEN - 1 byte + header (sizeof(struct net_buf))
	  amount of data.

	help
	  Copy the outgoing data to a net buffer so that the calling function
	  can discard the data.

config ISOTP_TX_BUF_COUNT
	int "Number of data buffers for sending data"
	default 4
	help
	  Each data buffer will occupy CONFIG_NET_BUF_DATA_SIZE + smallish
	  header (sizeof(struct net_buf)) amount of data. If context buffers
	  are used, use the same size here.

config ISOTP_BUF_TX_DATA_POOL_SIZE
	int "Size of the memory pool where buffers are allocated from"
	default 256

	  This value defines the size of the memory pool where the buffers
	  for sending are allocated from.
