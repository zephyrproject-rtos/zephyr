menuconfig SETTINGS
	bool "Settings"
	help
	  The settings subsystem allows its users to serialize and
	  deserialize state in memory into and from non-volatile memory.
	  It supports several back-ends to store and load serialized data from
	  and it can do so atomically for all involved modules.

	  Note: This settings backend compacts settings data into as few ITS nodes as possible.
	  On every save, the entire settings array is written to ITS.
	  Note: With this backend, all settings are kept in RAM at all times. The RAM consumption
	  is controlled by the SETTINGS_TFM_ITS_NUM_ENTRIES Kconfig option.

config SETTINGS_ZMS_NO_LL_DELETE
	bool "Disable deletion of Linked list hashes"
	help
	  For some applications, the Settings delete operation is too long for
	  ZMS because of the linked list update.
	  As a tradeoff for performance the linked list is not updated. As a
	  result, some nodes will be unused and will occupy some space in the
	  storage.
	  These nodes will be used again when the same Settings element that has
	  been deleted is created again.

	  Loads first the key defined by the subtree path.

config SETTINGS_TFM_ITS_LAZY_PERSIST_DELAY_MS
	int "Milliseconds delay before persisting settings"
	default 500
	help
	  ITS may block for a long period of time when writing to flash, which may be
	  unacceptable for time-sensitive events.
	  Data is always persisted to ITS using k_work_delayable, instead of happening in
	  the same context as settings_its_save. This option sets the delay with which the
	  work item is scheduled. The delay is useful in cases where a PSA ITS write may
	  block a time-sensitive event, Bluetooth pairing for example, which requires a
	  sequence of settings writes.
