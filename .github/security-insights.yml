          The Tool is run regularily on main, as well as for each pull request.
          The Quality gate is Zephyr Project, and most of the Quality Profiles have been
          customized to fit the projects needs.
          More information about the configuration can be found at:
          https://sonarcloud.io/project/information?id=zephyrproject-rtos_zephyr.

          Scan results of each pr request are available at
          https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=zephyrproject-rtos_zephyr&pullRequest={PR-NUMBER}
          A link to these artifacts is, also added to each PR.
          Violations of rules are currently not blocking pull requests.
