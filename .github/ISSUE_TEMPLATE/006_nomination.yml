        ## Background

        The [TSC Project Roles](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/project/project_roles.html) defines the main roles for the Zephyr Project, including Maintainer, Collaborator, and Contributor.

        By default, anyone who contributes code or documentation is a Contributor, but with the lowest [GitHub Permission Level](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization) of **Read**.

        - Add reviewers to pull requests
        - Be added as a reviewer by others
