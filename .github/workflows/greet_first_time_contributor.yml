            Hello @${{ github.event.pull_request.user.login }}, and thank you very much for your
            first pull request to the Zephyr project!


            A project maintainer just triggered our CI pipeline to run it against your PR and
            ensure it's compliant and doesn't cause any issues. You might want to take this
            opportunity to review the project's [Contributor
            Expectations](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/contribute/contributor_expectations.html)
            and make any updates to your pull request if necessary. 😊
