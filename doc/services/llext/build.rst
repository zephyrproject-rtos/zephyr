LLEXT Extension Development Kit
*******************************

To build the extensions to be loaded by the llext subsystem, it's necessary to
have access to the headers and compiler flags used by the main Zephyr
application. While building an extension as part of the Zephyr application
is straightforward, it can be more complex as a standalone project.

The LLEXT Extension Development Kit (EDK) provides a set of headers and compile
flags that can be used to build extensions as standalone projects. The EDK
can be generated by the Zephyr build system by running the following command
which uses the ``llext-edk`` target to generate the EDK:

.. code-block:: shell

    west build -t llext-edk

The generated EDK can be found in the build directory under the ``zephyr``
directory. It's a tarball that contains the headers and compile flags needed
to build extensions. The extension developer can then include the headers
and use the compile flags in their build system to build the extension.

Compile flags
-------------

Convenience files ``cmake.cflags`` (for CMake based projects) and
``Makefile.cflags`` are provided by the EDK containing the needed compile flags.
The main flag is ``LLEXT_CFLAGS`` which contains the flags needed to build an
extension. Also provided is a granular set of flags that can be used in support
of different use cases, such as when building mocks for unit tests. The provided
flags are:

- ``LLEXT_CFLAGS``: Flags needed to build an extension.
- ``LLEXT_ALL_INCLUDE_CFLAGS``: Include flags needed to include all headers.
- ``LLEXT_INCLUDE_CFLAGS``: Include flags for non build generated headers.
- ``LLEXT_GENERATED_INCLUDE_CFLAGS``: Include flags for build generated headers.
- ``LLEXT_BASE_CFLAGS``: All other flags needed to build an extension,
  excluding the include flags.
- ``LLEXT_GENERATED_IMACROS_CFLAGS``: Include only ``-imacros`` flags for build
  generated headers.

LLEXT EDK Kconfig options
-------------------------

The LLEXT EDK can be configured using the following Kconfig options:

:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LLEXT_EDK_NAME`
    The name of the generated EDK tarball.

:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LLEXT_EDK_USERSPACE_ONLY`
    If set, the EDK will include headers that do not contain code to route
    syscalls to the kernel. This is useful when building extensions that will
    run exclusively in user mode.

EDK Sample
----------

Refer to :zephyr:code-sample:`llext-edk` for an example of how to use the
LLEXT EDK.
