OS Abstraction
##############

OS abstraction layers (OSAL) provide wrapper function APIs that
encapsulate common system functions offered by any operating system.
These APIs make it easier and quicker to develop for, and port code to
multiple software and hardware platforms.

These sections describe the software and hardware abstraction layers
supported by the Zephyr RTOS.
