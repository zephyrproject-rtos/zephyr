.. _usb_dc_api:

USB device controller driver API (deprecated)
#############################################

The USB device controller driver API is described in
:zephyr_file:`include/zephyr/drivers/usb/usb_dc.h` and sometimes referred to
as the ``usb_dc`` API.

This API has some limitations by design, it does not follow :ref:`device_model_api`
and is being replaced by :ref:`udc_api`.
