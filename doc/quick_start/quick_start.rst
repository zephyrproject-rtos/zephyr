Quick Start Guide
#################

Follow this guide to install the Zephyr development environment on your
development system and to build the |codename| on the supported platforms.
Follow the steps appropriate for your development system's operating system.

Currently, the |project| supports Linux development systems only. This guide
was tested by compiling and running the |codename|'s sample applications on
the following Linux distributions:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64 bit
* Fedora 22 64 bit

Use these procedures only to create a new development
environment. Do not use them to update an existing environment. They do
not account for file hierarchy changes that may occur from release to
release.

Perform the steps in the installation procedures in the order they
appear.
