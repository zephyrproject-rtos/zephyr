Listing boards: ``west boards``
*******************************

The ``boards`` command can be used to list the boards that are supported by
Zephyr without having to resort to additional sources of information.

It can be run by typing::

  west boards

This command lists all supported boards in a default format. If you prefer to
specify the display format yourself you can use the ``--format`` (or ``-f``)
flag::

  west boards -f "{arch}:{name}"

Additional help about the formatting options can be found by running::

  west boards -h
