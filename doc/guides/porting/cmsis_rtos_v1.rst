CMSIS RTOS v1
##########################

Cortex-M Software Interface Standard (CMSIS) RTOS is a vendor-independent
hardware abstraction layer for the ARM Cortex®-M processor series and defines
generic tool interfaces. Though it was originally defined for ARM Cortex-M
microcontrollers alone, it could be easily extended to other microcontrollers
making it generic. For more information on CMSIS RTOS v1, please refer
