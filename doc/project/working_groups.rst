Advisory role

- Working Groups are advisory in nature. They provide advice to the projects and

  Security), where a formal vote can be taken, or advise the project that the
  working group cannot reach consensus.

- Working group meetings and offline discussions shall be captured in a
  standalone document with all supporting details such as attendance, quorum,
  actions to be taken, and next steps.
- Decisions made within a working group are non-binding and are only considered
  ratified after communicating decisions and outcomes to the TSC.
- Lacking any objections from the TSC within 1 week after the communication or
  report of any results, decisions of a working group are considered confirmed
  and ratified.
