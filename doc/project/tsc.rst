Appointed TSC Members
+++++++++++++++++++++

See `Zephyr project charter`_ for more details.

- Appointed TSC members have no term limits besides the term of their employment
  at the organization they represent or their organization's membership in the
  Zephyr Project.
- Appointed TSC members can select an Alternate from the same organization.

Elected TSC Members
+++++++++++++++++++

Per the `Zephyr project charter`_, TSC members can nominate representatives from
the technical community at the rate of no more than one per quarter.

- Majority vote is required to confirm a candidate.
- Once elected, a TSC member serves for 2 years.
- Elected TSC members do not have the right to appoint an Alternate.
- To ensure continuity of the TSC, at the end of the 2 year term, the TSC is
  required to reconfirm the membership of elected members. If the elected member
  declines a new term or if the TSC fails to reconfirm the term, the seat will
  be open for new nominations.
- If an elected TSC member resigns before the end of the 2 year term, their spot
  will be open for new members outside of the quarterly nomination limit. The
  elected member will serve a 2 year term.
- The TSC has the right to terminate elected members who become inactive and are
  not fulfilling the responsibilities of TSC members as described in this
  document.
- The number of elected members shall not exceed 20% of the total of appointed
  members.
- Existing TSC members who were elected before May 2024 shall be re-confirmed
  after completing the 2 year term since they were first elected.

Suspensions
+++++++++++

As noted under Section 8b of the Project Charter, voting rights for a
representative who misses three consecutive meetings are subject to suspension
and suspended representatives do not count towards the quorum requirement.

A representativeâ€™s suspension will end and voting rights be restored at the start
of the next attended meeting. The TSC enforces the suspension policy for voting
members who miss three consecutive TSC weekly meetings.

Multi-day meetings (F2F events) are counted as "one" meeting. The TSC voted on
February 16, 2022 to discontinue default enforcement of the suspension policy.
The TSC voted on January 18, 2023 to re-enact default enforcement of the
suspension policy.

Notice of suspension will be sent to representatives who miss three consecutive
meetings, noting that rights will be restored upon next attendance of a TSC
meeting.

.. note::

   As per Section 4b of the Project Charter, Platinum and Silver
   Members may choose to opt out of a voting seat on the TSC.

   Members who opt out and then wish to reclaim their seat later will have their
   voting rights restored at the start of the second consecutive meeting
   attended following notification to the TSC Chair.


Voting
++++++

Voting in the Zephyr Project is defined under Section 8 of the Project Charter.

Additional points of clarity / TSC interpretation have been added below. The
Governing Board may opt to update the Charter to include the below
refinements. Until then, additional clarifications (if/where needed) will be
discussed in the Process Working Group, and approved in the TSC.

- TSC In-Meeting Voting For items requesting an in-meeting vote of the Zephyr
  Technical Steering Committee (TSC), assuming quorum requirements have been
  met, the default voting mechanism will be a verbal motion to determine if
  there is general consensus.
- If there are no objections to a motion being brought forward, general
  consensus is assumed and the motion passes.
- Should there be any objections raised, the vote will move to email, and be
  executed using the Voting Guidelines outlined in Section 8 of the Project
  Charter.
- Should a motion be deemed urgent by the TSC Chair, and assuming quorum
  requirements have been met, the Chair may call for a roll call vote
  in-meeting.

Voting Options
--------------

- Voting Options are:

  - "Yes",
  - "No" or
  - "Abstain"

Abstention
----------

Abstentions do not count in tallying the vote negatively or positively; when
members abstain, they are in effect attending only to contribute to a quorum.

Abstentions do not impact the number of votes needed to decide a vote.

Quorum
------

Quorum for TSC meetings shall require 60% of the voting representatives... (ref
8b of the Charter)

Decisions
---------

Decisions by vote shall be based on a majority vote, provided that at least
sixty percent (60%) of the **TSC** representatives must be either
present or participating electronically or by written action in order to
conduct a valid vote. (ref 8c of the Charter)

Example A:

   40 eligible TSC voters. 3 abstain from a vote on a motion. 12 vote Yes. 11 vote
   No.

   Quorum reached: 26 votes cast (quorum = 60% of 40 = 24)
   Majority vote: 12 Yes vs. 11 No. Yes wins.
   Motion adopted.

Example B:

   40 eligible TSC voters. 5 abstain from a vote on a motion. 12 vote Yes. 6
   vote No. Quorum reached? 23 votes cast (quorum = 60% of 40 = 24)

   Vote is not valid. Quorum not reached.

Example C:

   40 eligible TSC voters. 21 abstain from a vote on a motion. 2 vote Yes. 1 votes
   No. Quorum reached? 24 votes cast (quorum = 60% of 40 = 24)

   Majority vote: 2 Yes vs. 1 No. Yes wins.

Immutable Votes
+++++++++++++++

Votes are considered immutable once cast. A voter may not change their vote,
once cast, between the time a Motion is brought forth and the time at which
results are announced.
