API Design Guidelines
#####################

Zephyr development and evolution is a group effort, and to simplify maintenance and enhancements
there are some general policies that should be followed when developing a new capability or
interface.

Using Callbacks
***************

Many APIs involve passing a callback as a parameter or as a member of a configuration structure.
The following policies should be followed when specifying the signature of a callback:

* The first parameter should be a pointer to the object most closely associated with the callback.
  In the case of device drivers this would be ``const struct device *dev``.  For library functions
  it may be a pointer to another object that was referenced when the callback was provided.

* The next parameter(s) should be additional information specific to the callback invocation, such
  as a channel identifier, new status value, and/or a message pointer followed by the message
  length.

* The final parameter should be a ``void *user_data`` pointer carrying context that allows a shared
  callback function to locate additional material necessary to process the callback.

An exception to providing ``user_data`` as the last parameter may be allowed when the callback
itself was provided through a structure that will be embedded in another structure.  An example of
such a case is :c:type:`gpio_callback`, normally defined within a data structure specific to the
code that also defines the callback function.  In those cases further context can accessed by the
callback indirectly by :c:macro:`CONTAINER_OF`.

Examples
========

* The requirements of :c:type:`k_timer_expiry_t` invoked when a system timer alarm fires are
  satisfied by::

    void handle_timeout(struct k_timer *timer)
    { ... }

  The assumption here, as with :c:type:`gpio_callback`, is that the timer is embedded in a structure
  reachable from :c:macro:`CONTAINER_OF` that can provide additional context to the callback.

* The requirements of :c:type:`counter_alarm_callback_t` invoked when a counter device alarm fires
  are satisfied by::

    void handle_alarm(const struct device *dev,
                      uint8_t chan_id,
		      uint32_t ticks,
		      void *user_data)
    { ... }

  This provides more complete useful information, including which counter channel timed-out and the
  counter value at which the timeout occurred, as well as user context which may or may not be the
  :c:type:`counter_alarm_cfg` used to register the callback, depending on user needs.

Conditional Data and APIs
*************************

APIs and libraries may provide features that are expensive in RAM or code size but are optional in
the sense that some applications can be implemented without them.  Examples of such feature include
:kconfig:option:`capturing a timestamp <CONFIG_CAN_RX_TIMESTAMP>` or :kconfig:option:`providing an
alternative interface <CONFIG_SPI_ASYNC>`.  The developer in coordination with the community must
determine whether enabling the features is to be controllable through a Kconfig option.

In the case where a feature is determined to be optional the following practices should be followed.

* Any data that is accessed only when the feature is enabled should be conditionally included via
  ``#ifdef CONFIG_MYFEATURE`` in the structure or union declaration.  This reduces memory use for
  applications that don't need the capability.
* Function declarations that are available only when the option is enabled should be provided
  unconditionally.  Add a note in the description that the function is available only when the
  specified feature is enabled, referencing the required Kconfig symbol by name. In the cases where
  the function is used but not enabled the definition of the function shall be excluded from
  compilation, so references to the unsupported API will result in a link-time error.
* Where code specific to the feature is isolated in a source file that has no other content that
  file should be conditionally included in ``CMakeLists.txt``::

    zephyr_sources_ifdef(CONFIG_MYFEATURE foo_funcs.c)
* Where code specific to the feature is part of a source file that has other content the
  feature-specific code should be conditionally processed using ``#ifdef CONFIG_MYFEATURE``.

The Kconfig flag used to enable the feature should be added to the ``PREDEFINED`` variable in
:file:`doc/zephyr.doxyfile.in` to ensure the conditional API and functions appear in generated
documentation.

Subsystem namespaces
********************
A subsystem can define its own naming conventions for symbols as long as the scheme doesn't collide
with Zephyr naming conventions :ref:`api_conventions.rst`. The naming convention should include a
namespace prefix (for example, bt\_ for Bluetooth LE, or net\_ for IP). This limits possible
collisions with symbols defined by an application.

Return Codes
************
Zephyr uses the standard codes in ``errno.h`` for all APIs. As a general rule, 0 indicates success;
a negative ``errno.h`` code indicates an error condition.

Implementations of an API, for example an API for accessing a peripheral might implement only a
subset of the functions that is required for minimal operation. A distinction is needed between APIs
that are not supported and those that are not implemented or optional:

- APIs that are supported but not implemented shall return ``-ENOSYS``.

- Optional APIs that are not supported by the hardware should be implemented and the return code in
  this case shall be ``-ENOTSUP``.

- When an API is implemented but the particular combination of options requested in the call cannot
  be satisfied by the implementation, the call shall return ``-ENOTSUP``. (For example, a request
  for a level-triggered GPIO interrupt on hardware that supports only edge-triggered interrupts)
