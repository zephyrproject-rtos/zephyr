West (Zephyr's meta-tool)
#########################

The Zephyr project includes a swiss-army knife command line tool named
``west``\ [#west-name]_. West is developed in its own `repository`_.

West's built-in commands provide a multiple repository management system with
features inspired by Google's Repo tool and Git submodules. West is also
"pluggable": you can write your own west extension commands which add
additional features to west. Zephyr uses this to provide conveniences for
building applications, flashing and debugging them, and more.

Like ``git`` and ``docker``, the top-level ``west`` command takes some common
options, a sub-command to run, and then options and arguments for that
sub-command::

  west [common-opts] <command> [opts] <args>

Since west v0.8, you can also run west like this::

  python3 -m west [common-opts] <command> [opts] <args>

You can run ``west --help`` (or ``west -h`` for short) to get top-level help
for available west commands, and ``west <command> -h`` for detailed help on
each command.
