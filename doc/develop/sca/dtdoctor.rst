Devicetree diagnostics (``dtdoctor``)
#####################################

``dtdoctor`` is a static analysis tool that helps diagnose Devicetree-related build errors.

It intercepts error messages from the compiler and linker and, when they refer to unresolved
Devicetree device symbols (e.g. ``__device_dts_ord_*``), provides detailed information about what
might be causing the error and how to fix it.

Using dtdoctor
**************

To enable ``dtdoctor``, build with ``-DZEPHYR_SCA_VARIANT=dtdoctor``.

For example:

.. code-block:: shell

   west build -b reel_board samples/basic/blinky -- -DZEPHYR_SCA_VARIANT=dtdoctor
