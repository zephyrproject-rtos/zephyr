Overview
********
IEEE 802.15.4 is a technical standard which defines the operation of low-rate
wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs). For more detailed overview of this
standard, see this
`IEEE 802.15.4 Wikipedia article <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4>`_.
Also, see `IEEE GET Program
<https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/standards/get-program/page/series?id=68>`_
for creating an IEEE account and downloading the specification.

Zephyr supports IEEE 802.15.4 with Thread and 6LoWPAN. The Thread implementation
is based on `OpenThread <https://openthread.io/>`_.
The IPv6 header compression in 6LoWPAN is shared with
the Bluetooth IPSP (IP support profile).
