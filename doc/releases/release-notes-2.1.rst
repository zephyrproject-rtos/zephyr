Build and Infrastructure
************************

* Deprecated kconfig functions dt_int_val, dt_hex_val, and dt_str_val.
  Use new functions that utilize eDTS info such as dt_node_reg_addr.
  See :zephyr_file:`scripts/kconfig/kconfigfunctions.py` for details.

* Deprecated direct use of the ``DT_`` Kconfig symbols from the generated
  ``generated_dts_board.conf``.  This was done to have a single source of
  Kconfig symbols coming from only Kconfig (additionally the build should
  be slightly faster).  For Kconfig files we should utilize functions from
  :zephyr_file:`scripts/kconfig/kconfigfunctions.py`.  See
  :ref:`kconfig-functions` for usage details.  For sanitycheck yaml usage
  we should utilize functions from
  :zephyr_file:`scripts/sanity_chk/expr_parser.py`.  Its possible that a
  new function might be required for a particular use pattern that isn't
  currently supported.

* Various parts of the binding format have been simplified. The format is
  better documented now too.

Libraries / Subsystems
***********************

* Random

  * Add cryptographically secure random functions
  * Add bulk fill random functions

HALs
****

* HALs are now moved out of the main tree as external modules and reside in
  their own standalone repositories.

Documentation
*************

* A new Getting Started Guide simplifies and streamlines the "out of
  box" experience for developers, from setting up their development
  environment through running the blinky sample.
* Many additions and updates to architecture, build, and process docs including
  sanity check, board porting, Bluetooth, scheduling, timing,
  peripherals, configuration, and user mode.
* Documentation for new boards and samples.
* Improvements and clarity of API documentation.

Tests and Samples
*****************

* We have implemented additional tests and significantly expanded the amount
  of test cases in existing tests to increase code coverage.
