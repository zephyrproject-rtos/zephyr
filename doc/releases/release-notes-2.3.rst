Zephyr 2.3.0
############

We are pleased to announce the release of Zephyr RTOS version 2.3.0.

Major enhancements with this release include:

* A new Zephyr CMake package has been introduced, reducing the need for
  environment variables
* A new Devicetree API, based on hierarchical macros, has been introduced. This
  new API allows the C code to access virtually all nodes and properties in a
  clean, organized fashion
* The kernel timeout API has been overhauled to be flexible and configurable,
  with future support for features like 64-bit and absolute timeouts in mind
* A new k_heap/sys_heap heap allocator has been introduced, with much better
  performance than the existing k_mem_pool/sys_mem_pool
* Zephyr now integrates with the TF-M (Trusted Firmware M) PSA-compliant
  framework
* The Bluetooth Low Energy Host now supports LE Advertising Extensions
* The CMSIS-DSP library is now included and integrated

The following sections provide detailed lists of changes by component.

Known issues
************

You can check all currently known issues by listing them using the GitHub
interface and listing all issues with the `bug label
<https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug>`_.

A single high-priority bug is currently open:

* :github:`23364` - Bluetooth: bt_recv deadlock on supervision timeout with
  pending GATT Write Commands

API Changes
***********

* HWINFO

  * The identifier data structure for hwinfo drivers is clarified.  Drivers are
    responsible for ensuring that the identifier data structure is a sequence
    of bytes. The returned ID value is not supposed to be interpreted based on
    vendor-specific assumptions of byte order and should express the identifier
    as a raw byte sequence.
    The changes have an impact on users that use the hwinfo API to identify
    their devices.
    The sam0 driver byte swaps each 32 bit word of the 128 bit identifier to
    big endian.
    The nordic driver byte swaps the entire 64 bit word to big endian.

* I2C

  * Added a new API for recovering an I2C bus from situations where the I2C
    master and one or more I2C slaves are out of synchronization (e.g. if the
    I2C master was reset in the middle of an I2C transaction or if a noise
    pulse was induced on the SCL line).

Deprecated in this release
==========================

* Kernel

  * k_uptime_delta_32(), use k_uptime_delta()
  * Timeout values

    * All timeout values are now encapsulated k_timeout_t opaque structure when
      passing them to the kernel. If you want to revert to the previous s32_t
      type for the timeout parameter, please enable
      CONFIG_LEGACY_TIMEOUT_API

* Bluetooth

  * BT_LE_SCAN_FILTER_DUPLICATE, use BT_LE_SCAN_OPT_FILTER_DUPLICATE instead
  * BT_LE_SCAN_FILTER_WHITELIST, use BT_LE_SCAN_OPT_FILTER_WHITELIST instead
  * bt_le_scan_param::filter_dup, use bt_le_scan_param::options instead
  * bt_conn_create_le(), use bt_conn_le_create() instead
  * bt_conn_create_auto_le(), use bt_conn_le_create_auto() instead
  * bt_conn_create_slave_le(), use bt_le_adv_start() instead with
    bt_le_adv_param::peer set to the remote peers address.
  * BT_LE_ADV_* macros, use BT_GAP_ADV_* enums instead

  * nrf52_pca20020 has been renamed to thingy52_nrf52832

  * efr32_slwstk6061a has been renamed to efr32_radio_brd4250b

* Devicetree

  * The C macros generated from the devicetree in previous releases are now
    deprecated in favor of a new ``<devicetree.h>`` API.
  * See :ref:`dt-from-c` for a high-level guide to the new API, and
    :ref:`devicetree_api` for an API reference.
  * Use of the legacy macros now requires explicitly enabling
    ``CONFIG_LEGACY_DEVICETREE_MACROS``. See `the Zephyr v2.3 legacy devicetree
    macro page`_ for more information, including a link to a migration guide to
    the new API.

.. _the Zephyr v2.3 legacy devicetree macro page:
   https://docs.zephyrproject.org/2.3.0/guides/dts/legacy-macros.html#dt-legacy-macros

* Other

  * ``MACRO_MAP`` has been deprecated. Use ``FOR_EACH`` instead.
  * ``BUILD_ASSERT_MSG`` has been deprecated. Use ``BUILD_ASSERT`` instead.

Removed APIs in this release
============================

* The ``INLINE`` macro in ``util.h`` has been removed.
* ``STACK_ANALYZE``, ``stack_analyze`` and ``stack_unused_space_get`` have been
  removed.


Stable API changes in this release
==================================

* Bluetooth Mesh

  * The net_idx parameter has been removed from the Health Client model
    APIs since it can be derived (by the stack) from the app_idx parameter

* Networking

  * The NET_DEVICE_INIT(), NET_DEVICE_INIT_INSTANCE(), NET_DEVICE_OFFLOAD_INIT()
    and ETH_NET_DEVICE_INIT() macros changed and take a device power management
    function pointer parameter. If networking PM is not implemented for the
    specific network device, the device_pm_control_nop value can be used.

* Video

  * The video_dequeue() API call now takes a k_timeout_t for the timeout
    parameter. This reverts to s32_t if CONFIG_LEGACY_TIMEOUT_API is enabled.

* Floating Point Services

  * FLOAT and FP_SHARING Kconfig options have been renamed to FPU and FPU_SHARING,
    respectively.

Kernel
******

* A new general purpose memory allocator, sys_heap/k_heap, has been added
  to Zephyr with more conventional API/behavior, better space
  efficiency and higher performance than the pre-existing mem_pool.
  The older mem_pool APIs are, by default, wrappers around this new
  heap backend and will be deprecated in an upcoming release.  The
  original implementation remains available for this release via
  disabling CONFIG_MEM_POOL_HEAP_BACKEND.
* The timeout arguments to all kernel calls are now a "k_timeout_t"
  type instead of a 32 bit millisecond count.  These can be
  initialized in arbitrary time units (ns/us/ms, ticks), be
  interpreted relative to either current time or system start, and be
  expressed in 64 bit quantities.  This involves a minor change to the
  API, so the original API is still available in a completely
  source-compatible way via CONFIG_LEGACY_TIMEOUT_API.
* Simplified dummy thread implementation and properly name idle threads
* Centralized new thread priority check
* Refactored device structures and introduced struct init_entry which is
  a generic init end-point. SYS_INIT() generates only a struct init_entry via
  calling INIT_ENTRY_DEFINE(). Also removed struct deviceconfig leaving
  struct device to own everything now.

Build and Infrastructure
************************

* Zephyr CMake package

  * The Zephyr main repository now includes a Zephyr CMake package.
    This allows for registering Zephyr in the CMake user package registry and
    allows for easier integration into Zephyr applications, by using the CMake
    function, ``find_package(Zephyr ...)``.
    Registering the Zephyr CMake package in the CMake user package registry
    removes the need for setting of ``ZEPHYR_BASE``, sourcing ``zephyr-env.sh``,
    or running ``zephyr-env.cmd``.
  * A new ``west`` extension command, ``west zephyr-export`` is introduced for easy
    registration of Zephyr CMake package in the CMake user package registry.
  * Zephyr Build Configuration CMake package hook.
    Zephyr offers the possibility of configuring the Zephyr build system through
    a Zephyr Build Configuration package. A single Zephyr workspace
    ``ZephyrBuildConfig.cmake`` will be loaded if present in the Zephyr
    workspace. This allows users to configure the Zephyr build system on a per
    workspace setup, as an alternative to using a ``.zephyrrc`` system wide file.

* Devicetree

  * A new :ref:`devicetree_api` was added. This API is not generated, but is
    still included via ``<devicetree.h>``.

    See `the Zephyr v2.3 legacy devicetree macro page`_ for more information,
    including a link to a migration guide to the new API.

    The :ref:`dt-howtos` page has been extended for the new API, and a new
    :ref:`dt-from-c` API usage guide was also added.

Libraries / Subsystems
**********************

* Disk

  * Add stm32 sdmmc disk access driver, supports stm32f7 and stm32l4

* Random

  * Removed the ``rand32_timestamp`` driver.

  * eventfd() function (Linux-like extension) implemented.

HALs
****

* HALs are now moved out of the main tree as external modules and reside in
  their own standalone repositories.

Documentation
*************

* New API overview page added.
* Reference pages have been cleaned up and organized.
* The Devicetree documentation has been expanded significally.
