API Changes
***********

* Removed SETTINGS_USE_BASE64 support as its been deprecated for more than
  two releases.

* The :c:func:`lwm2m_rd_client_start` function now accepts an additional
  ``flags`` parameter, which allows to configure current LwM2M client session,
  for instance enable bootstrap procedure in the curent session.

* Changed vcnl4040 dts binding default for property 'proximity-trigger'.
  Changed the default to match the HW POR state for this property.

Bluetooth
*********

* Host

* Mesh

* BLE split software Controller

* HCI Driver

Build and Infrastructure
************************

* Improved support for additional toolchains:

* Devicetree

  * :c:macro:`DT_ENUM_IDX_OR`: new macro
  * Support for legacy devicetree macros via
    ``CONFIG_LEGACY_DEVICETREE_MACROS`` was removed. All devicetree-based code
    should be using the new devicetree API introduced in Zephyr 2.3 and
    documented in :ref:`dt-from-c`. Information on flash partitions has moved
    to :ref:`flash_map_api`.

Libraries / Subsystems
**********************

* Disk

* Management

  * MCUmgr

  * updatehub

* Settings

* Random

* POSIX subsystem

* Power management

* Logging

* LVGL

* Shell

* Storage

* Tracing

* Debug

HALs
****

* HALs are now moved out of the main tree as external modules and reside in
  their own standalone repositories.

MCUBoot
*******

* bootloader

  * Added hardening against hardware level fault injection and timing attacks,
    see ``CONFIG_BOOT_FIH_PROFILE_HIGH`` and similar kconfig options.
  * Introduced Abstract crypto primitives to simplify porting.
  * Added ram-load upgrade mode (not enabled for zephy-rtos yet).
  * Renamed single-image mode to single-slot mode,
    see ``CONFIG_SINGLE_APPLICATION_SLOT``.
  * Added patch for turning off cache for Cortex M7 before chain-loading.
  * Fixed boostrapping in swap-move mode.
  * Fixed issue causing that interrupted swap-move operation might brick device
    if the primary image was padded.
  * Fixed issue causing that HW stack protection catches the chain-loaded
    application during its early ini, by disableing HW stack protection
    (temporary hack).
  * Added reset of Cortex SPLIM registers before boot.
  * Fixesd build issue that occurs if CONF_FILE contains multiple file paths
    instead of single file path.

* imgtool

  * Print image digest during verify.
  * Add possibility to set confirm flag for hex files as well.
  * Usage of --confirm implies --pad.
  * Fixed 'custom_tlvs' argument handling.
