Zephyr 2.2.0 (Working Draft)
############################

We are pleased to announce the release of Zephyr kernel version 2.2.0.

Major enhancements with this release include:

* CANopen protocol support through 3rd party CANopenNode stack

The following sections provide detailed lists of changes by component.

Security Vulnerability Related
******************************

No security vulnerabilities received.

API Changes
***********

Deprecated in this release
==========================

* Settings

  * SETTINGS_USE_BASE64, encoding values in base64 is marked for removal.

Stable API changes in this release
==================================

* PWM

  * The pwm_pin_set_cycles(), pwm_pin_set_usec(), and
    pwm_pin_set_nsec() functions now take a flags parameter. The newly
    introduced flags are PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL and PWM_POLARITY_INVERTED
    for specifying the polarity of the PWM signal. The flags parameter
    can be set to 0 if no flags are required (the default is
    PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL).
  * Similarly, the pwm_pin_set_t PWM driver API function function now
    takes a flags parameter. The PWM controller driver must check the
    value of the flags parameter and return -ENOTSUP if any
    unsupported flag is set.

* USB

  * The usb_enable() function, which was previously invoked automatically
    by the USB stack, now needs to be explicitly called by the application
    in order to enable the USB subsystem.
  * The usb_enable() function now takes a parameter, usb_dc_status_callback
    which can be set by the application to a callback to receive status events
    from the USB stack. The parameter can also be set to NULL if no callback is required.

* nRF flash driver

  * The nRF Flash driver has changed its default write block size to 32-bit
    aligned. Previous emulation of 8-bit write block size can be selected using
    the CONFIG_SOC_FLASH_NRF_EMULATE_ONE_BYTE_WRITE_ACCESS Kconfig option.
    Usage of 8-bit write block size emulation is only recommended for
    compatibility with older storage contents.

Removed APIs in this release
============================

* Shell

  * SHELL_CREATE_STATIC_SUBCMD_SET (deprecated), replaced by
    SHELL_STATIC_SUBCMD_SET_CREATE
  * SHELL_CREATE_DYNAMIC_CMD (deprecated), replaced by SHELL_DYNAMIC_CMD_CREATE

* Newtron Flash File System (NFFS) was removed. NFFS was removed since it has
    serious issues, not fixed since a long time. Where it was possible
    NFFS usage was replaced by LittleFS usage as the better substitute.

Build and Infrastructure
************************

* The minimum Python version supported by Zephyr's build system and tools is
  now 3.6.
* Renamed :file:`generated_dts_board.h` and :file:`generated_dts_board.conf` to
  :file:`devicetree.h` and :file:`devicetree.conf`, along with various related
  identifiers. Including :file:`generated_dts_board.h` now generates a warning
  saying to include :file:`devicetree.h` instead.
* <Other items TBD>

Libraries / Subsystems
***********************

* Random

  * <TBD>

HALs
****

* HALs are now moved out of the main tree as external modules and reside in
  their own standalone repositories.
