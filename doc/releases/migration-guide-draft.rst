################################################

Any other changes (not directly related to migrating applications) can be found in
the :ref:`release notes<zephyr_4.6>`.

Common
******

* The :file:`scripts/footprint/size_report`, :file:`scripts/footprint/compare_footprint`, and
  :file:`scripts/kconfig/diffconfig` scripts have been renamed to
  :file:`scripts/footprint/size_report.py`, :file:`scripts/footprint/compare_footprint.py`, and
  :file:`scripts/kconfig/diffconfig.py`, respectively. Users must update their invocations.

Device Drivers and Devicetree
*****************************

.. Only place contents common to all device drivers here. Contents specific to one driver subsystem
   goes into its own subsection, below.

Ethernet
========

* :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ETH_PHY_DRIVER` is no longer enabled by default. It is now selected by
  the Ethernet drivers that need a PHY driver. Out-of-tree Ethernet drivers that use a PHY driver
  must select it as well. (:github:`120871`)

.. zephyr-keep-sorted-stop

Bluetooth
*********

Bluetooth Classic
=================

* The L2CAP BR/EDR ECHO API is now only available with :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_TESTING`:
  :c:struct:`bt_l2cap_br_echo_cb`, :c:func:`bt_l2cap_br_echo_cb_register`,
  :c:func:`bt_l2cap_br_echo_cb_unregister`, :c:func:`bt_l2cap_br_echo_req` and
  :c:func:`bt_l2cap_br_echo_rsp`. The stack answers a received ECHO request with an ECHO response
  without data, unless a registered ``req`` callback handles it.
