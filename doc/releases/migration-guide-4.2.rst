Migration guide to Zephyr v4.2.0 (Working Draft)
################################################

This document describes the changes required when migrating your application from Zephyr v4.1.0 to
Zephyr v4.2.0.

Any other changes (not directly related to migrating applications) can be found in
the :ref:`release notes<zephyr_4.2>`.

Build System
************

Kernel
******

Boards
******

* All boards based on Nordic ICs that used the ``nrfjprog`` Nordic command-line
  tool for flashing by default have been modified to instead default to the new
  nRF Util (``nrfutil``) tool. This means that you may need to `install nRF Util
  <https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nrf-util>`_ or, if you
  prefer to continue using ``nrfjprog``, you can do so by invoking west while
  specfying the runner: ``west flash -r nrfjprog``. The full documentation for
  nRF Util can be found
  `here <https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrfutil/page/README.html>`_.

* The config option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NATIVE_POSIX_SLOWDOWN_TO_REAL_TIME` has been deprecated
  in favor of :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NATIVE_SIM_SLOWDOWN_TO_REAL_TIME`.

* Zephyr now supports version 1.11.1 of the :zephyr:board:`neorv32`.

Device Drivers and Devicetree
*****************************

Ethernet
========

* Removed Kconfig option ``ETH_STM32_HAL_MII`` (:github:`86074`).
  PHY interface type is now selected via the ``phy-connection-type`` property in the device tree.

GPIO
====

* To support the RP2350B, which has many pins, the RaspberryPi-GPIO configuration has
  been changed. The previous role of :dtcompatible:`raspberrypi,rpi-gpio` has been migrated to
  :dtcompatible:`raspberrypi,rpi-gpio-port`, and :dtcompatible:`raspberrypi,rpi-gpio` is
  now left as a placeholder and mapper.
  The labels have also been changed along, so no changes are necessary for regular use.

Bluetooth
*********

Bluetooth Host
==============

* The symbols ``BT_LE_CS_TONE_ANTENNA_CONFIGURATION_INDEX_<NUMBER>`` in
  :zephyr_file:`include/zephyr/bluetooth/conn.h` have been renamed
  to ``BT_LE_CS_TONE_ANTENNA_CONFIGURATION_A<NUMBER>_B<NUMBER>``.
