Clock Control
=============

* The :dtcompatible:`nxp,imxrt11xx-arm-pll` binding now uses ``loop-div`` and
  ``post-div`` for ARM PLL configuration. The legacy ``clock-mult`` and
  ``clock-div`` properties remain supported but are deprecated. Existing
  RT11xx overlays should be updated using the mapping
  ``loop-div = clock-mult * 2`` and ``post-div = clock-div``.
