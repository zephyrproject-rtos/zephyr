  * The hardware capabilities IEEE802154_HW_2_4_GHZ and IEEE802154_HW_SUB_GHZ
    were removed as they were not aligned with the standard and some already
    existing drivers couldn't properly express their channel page and channel
    range (notably SUN FSK and HRP UWB drivers). The capabilities were replaced
    by the standard conforming new driver attribute
    IEEE802154_ATTR_PHY_SUPPORTED_CHANNEL_PAGES that fits all in-tree drivers.
  * The method get_subg_channel_count() was removed from ieee802154_radio_api.
    This method could not properly express the channel range of existing drivers
    (notably SUN FSK drivers that implement channel pages > 0 and may not have
    zero-based channel ranges or UWB drivers that could not be represented at
    all). The method was replaced by the new driver attribute
    IEEE802154_ATTR_PHY_SUPPORTED_CHANNEL_RANGES that fits all in-tree drivers.

Networking
**********

* CoAP:

  * Optimized CoAP client library to use only a single thread internally.
  * Converted CoAP client library to use ``zsock_*`` API internally.
  * Fixed a bug in CoAP client library, which resulted in an incorrect
    retransmission timeout calculation.
  * Use 64 bit timer values for calculating transmission timeouts. This fixes potential problems for
    devices that stay on for more than 49 days when the 32 bit uptime counter might roll over and
    cause CoAP packets to not timeout at all on this event.
  * API documentation improvements.
  * Added new API functions:

    * :c:func:`coap_has_descriptive_block_option`
    * :c:func:`coap_remove_descriptive_block_option`
    * :c:func:`coap_packet_remove_option`
    * :c:func:`coap_packet_set_path`

* Connection Manager:

  * Added support for auto-connect and auto-down behaviors (controlled by
    :c:enum:`CONN_MGR_IF_NO_AUTO_CONNECT` and :c:enum:`CONN_MGR_IF_NO_AUTO_DOWN`
    flags).
  * Split Connection Manager APIs into separate header files.
  * Extended Connection Manager documentation to cover new functionalities.

* DHCP:

  * Added support for DHCPv4 unicast replies processing.
  * Added support for DHCPv6 protocol.

* Ethernet:

  * Fixed ARP queueing so that the queued network packet is sent immediately
    instead of queued 2nd time in the core network stack.

* gPTP:

  * Added support for detecting gPTP packets that use the default multicast destination address.
  * Fixed Announce and Follow Up message handling.

* ICMP:

  * Fixed ICMPv6 error message type check.
  * Reworked ICMP callback registration and handling, which allows to register
    multiple handlers for the same ICMP message.
  * Introduced an API to send ICMP Echo Request (ping).
  * Added possibility to register offloaded ICMP ping handlers.
  * Added support for setting packet priority for ping.

* IPv6:

  * Made sure that ongoing DAD procedure is cancelled when IPv6 address is removed.
  * Fixed a bug, where Solicited-Node multicast address could be removed while
    still in use.

* LwM2M:

  * Added support for tickless mode. This removes the 500 ms timeout from the socket loop
    so the engine does not constantly wake up the CPU. This can be enabled by
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LWM2M_TICKLESS`.
  * Added new :c:macro:`LWM2M_RD_CLIENT_EVENT_DEREGISTER` event.
  * Block-wise sending now supports LwM2M read and composite-read operations as well.
    When :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LWM2M_COAP_BLOCK_TRANSFER` is enabled, any content that is larger
    than :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LWM2M_COAP_MAX_MSG_SIZE` is split into a block-wise transfer.
  * Block-wise transfers don't require tokens to match anymore as this was not in line
    with CoAP specification (CoAP doesn't require tokens reuse).
  * Various fixes to bootstrap. Now client ensures that Bootstrap-Finish command is sent,
    before closing the DTLS pipe. Also allows Bootstrap server to close the DTLS pipe.
    Added timeout when waiting for bootstrap commands.
  * Added support for X509 certificates.
  * Various fixes to string handling. Allow setting string to zero length.
    Ensure string termination when using string operations on opaque resources.
  * Added support for Connection Monitoring object version 1.3.
  * Added protection for Security object to prevent read/writes by the server.
  * Fixed a possible notification stall in case of observation token change.
  * Added new shell command, ``lwm2m create``, which allows to create LwM2M object instances.
  * Added LwM2M interoperability test-suite against Leshan server.
  * API documentation improvements.
  * Several other minor fixes and improvements.

* Misc:

  * Time and timestamps in the network subsystem, PTP and IEEE 802.15.4
    were more precisely specified and all in-tree call sites updated accordingly.
    Fields for timed TX and TX/RX timestamps have been consolidated. See
    :c:type:`net_time_t`, :c:struct:`net_ptp_time`, :c:struct:`ieee802154_config`,
    :c:struct:`ieee802154_radio_api` and :c:struct:`net_pkt` for extensive
    documentation. As this is largely an internal API, existing applications will
    most probably continue to work unchanged.
  * Added support for additional net_pkt filter hooks:

    * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NET_PKT_FILTER_IPV4_HOOK`
    * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NET_PKT_FILTER_IPV6_HOOK`
    * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NET_PKT_FILTER_LOCAL_IN_HOOK`

  * Reworked several networking components to use timepoint API.
  * Added API functions facilitate going through all IPv4/IPv6 registered on an
    interface (:c:func:`net_if_ipv4_addr_foreach`, :c:func:`net_if_ipv6_addr_foreach`).
  * ``NET_EVENT_IPV6_PREFIX_ADD`` and ``NET_EVENT_IPV6_PREFIX_DEL`` events now provide
    more detailed information about the prefix (:c:struct:`net_event_ipv6_prefix`).
  * General cleanup of the shadowed variables across the networking subsystem.
  * Added ``qemu_cortex_a53`` networking support.
  * Introduced new modem subsystem.
  * Added new :zephyr:code-sample:`cellular-modem` sample.
  * Added support for network interface names (instead of reusing underlying device name).
  * Removed support for Google Cloud IoT sample due to service retirement.
  * Fixed a bug where packets passed in promiscuous mode could have been modified
    by L2 in certain cases.
  * Added support for setting syslog server (used for networking log backend)
    IP address at runtime.
  * Removed no longer used ``queued`` and ``sent`` net_pkt flags.
  * Added support for binding zperf TCP/UDP server to a specific IP address.

* MQTT-SN:

  * Improved thread safety of internal buffers allocation.
  * API documentation improvements.

* OpenThread:

  * Reworked :c:func:`otPlatEntropyGet` to use :c:func:`sys_csrand_get` internally.
  * Introduced ``ieee802154_radio_openthread.h`` radio driver extension interface
    specific for OpenThread. Added new transmit mode, specific to OpenThread,
    :c:enum:`IEEE802154_OPENTHREAD_TX_MODE_TXTIME_MULTIPLE_CCA`.

* PPP:

  * Fixed PPP L2 usage of the network interface carrier state.
  * Made PPP L2 thread priority configurable (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NET_L2_PPP_THREAD_PRIO`).
  * Moved PPP L2 out of experimental stage.
  * Prevent PPP connection reestablish when carrier is down.

  * Fixed input filtering for connected datagram sockets.
  * Fixed :c:func:`getsockname` operation on unconnected sockets.
  * Added new secure socket options for DTLS Connection ID support:

    * :c:macro:`TLS_DTLS_CID`
    * :c:macro:`TLS_DTLS_CID_VALUE`
    * :c:macro:`TLS_DTLS_PEER_CID_VALUE`
    * :c:macro:`TLS_DTLS_CID_STATUS`

  * Added support for :c:macro:`SO_REUSEADDR` and :c:macro:`SO_REUSEPORT` socket options.

* TCP:

  * Fixed potential stall in data retransmission, when data was only partially acknowledged.
  * Made TCP work queue priority configurable (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NET_TCP_WORKER_PRIO`).
  * Added support for TCP new Reno collision avoidance algorithm.
  * Fixed source address selection on bound sockets.
  * Fixed possible memory leak in case listening socket was closed during active handshake.
  * Fixed RST packet handling during handshake.
  * Refactored the code responsible for connection teardown to fix found bugs and
    simplify future maintenance.

* TFTP:

  * Added new :zephyr:code-sample:`tftp-client` sample.
  * API documentation improvements.

* WebSocket

  * WebSocket library no longer closes underlying TCP socket automatically on disconnect.
    This aligns with the connect behavior, where the WebSocket library expects an already
    connected TCP socket.

* Wi-Fi:

  * Added Passive scan support.
  * The Wi-Fi scan API updated with Wi-Fi scan parameter to allow scan mode selection.
  * Updated TWT handling.
  * Added support for generic network manager API.

* Management

  * Introduced MCUmgr client support with handlers for img_mgmt and os_mgmt.

  * Added response checking to MCUmgr's :c:enumerator:`MGMT_EVT_OP_CMD_RECV`
    notification callback to allow applications to reject MCUmgr commands.

  * MCUmgr SMP version 2 error translation (to legacy MCUmgr error code) is now
    supported in function handlers by setting ``mg_translate_error`` of
    :c:struct:`mgmt_group` when registering a group. See
    :c:type:`smp_translate_error_fn` for function details.

  * Fixed an issue with MCUmgr img_mgmt group whereby the size of the upload in
    the initial packet was not checked.

  * Fixed an issue with MCUmgr fs_mgmt group whereby some status codes were not
    checked properly, this meant that the error returned might not be the
    correct error, but would only occur in situations where an error was
    already present.

  * Fixed an issue whereby the SMP response function did not check to see if
    the initial zcbor map was created successfully.

  * Fixes an issue with MCUmgr shell_mgmt group whereby the length of a
    received command was not properly checked.

  * Added optional mutex locking support to MCUmgr img_mgmt group, which can
    be enabled with :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUMGR_GRP_IMG_MUTEX`.

  * Added MCUmgr settings management group, which allows for manipulation of
    zephyr settings from a remote device, see :ref:`mcumgr_smp_group_3` for
    details.

  * Added :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUMGR_GRP_IMG_ALLOW_CONFIRM_NON_ACTIVE_IMAGE_SECONDARY`
    and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUMGR_GRP_IMG_ALLOW_CONFIRM_NON_ACTIVE_IMAGE_ANY`
    that allow to control whether MCUmgr client will be allowed to confirm
    non-active images.

  * Added :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUMGR_GRP_IMG_ALLOW_ERASE_PENDING` that allows
    to erase slots pending for next boot, that are not revert slots.

  * Added ``user_data`` as an optional field to :c:struct:`mgmt_handler` when
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUMGR_MGMT_HANDLER_USER_DATA` is enabled.

  * Added optional ``force`` parameter to os mgmt reset command, this can be checked in the
    :c:enum:`MGMT_EVT_OP_OS_MGMT_RESET` notification callback whose data structure is
    :c:struct:`os_mgmt_reset_data`.

  * Added configurable number of SMP encoding levels via
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUMGR_SMP_CBOR_MIN_ENCODING_LEVELS`, which automatically increments
    minimum encoding levels for in-tree groups if :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ZCBOR_CANONICAL` is
    enabled.

  * Added STM32 SPI backend for EC Host command protocol.

  * Fixed settings_mgmt returning unknown error instead of invalid key specified error.

  * Fixed fs_mgmt returning parameter too large error instead of file is empty error when
    attempting to hash/checksum a file which is empty.

* File systems

  * Added support for ext2 file system.
  * Added support of mounting littlefs on the block device from the shell/fs.
  * Added alignment parameter to FS_LITTLEFS_DECLARE_CUSTOM_CONFIG macro, it can speed up read/write
    operation for SDMMC devices in case when we align buffers on CONFIG_SDHC_BUFFER_ALIGNMENT,
    because we can avoid extra copy of data from card buffer to read/prog buffer.

* Random

  * ``CONFIG_XOROSHIRO_RANDOM_GENERATOR``, deprecated a long time ago, is finally removed.

* Retention

  * Added the :ref:`blinfo_api` subsystem.

  * Added support for allowing mutex support to be forcibly disabled with
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_RETENTION_MUTEX_FORCE_DISABLE`.

* Binary descriptors

  * Added the :ref:`binary_descriptors` (``bindesc``) subsystem.

* POSIX API

  * Added dynamic thread stack support for :c:func:`pthread_create`
  * Fixed :c:func:`stat` so that it returns file stats instead of filesystem stats
  * Implemented :c:func:`pthread_barrierattr_destroy`, :c:func:`pthread_barrierattr_getpshared`,
    :c:func:`pthread_barrierattr_init`, :c:func:`pthread_barrierattr_setpshared`,
    :c:func:`pthread_condattr_destroy`, :c:func:`pthread_condattr_init`,
    :c:func:`pthread_mutexattr_destroy`, :c:func:`pthread_mutexattr_init`, :c:func:`uname`,
    :c:func:`sigaddset`, :c:func:`sigdelset`, :c:func:`sigemptyset`, :c:func:`sigfillset`,
    :c:func:`sigismember`, :c:func:`strsignal`, :c:func:`pthread_spin_destroy`,
    :c:func:`pthread_spin_init`, :c:func:`pthread_spin_lock`, :c:func:`pthread_spin_trylock`,
    :c:func:`pthread_spin_unlock`, :c:func:`timer_getoverrun`, :c:func:`pthread_condattr_getclock`,
    :c:func:`pthread_condattr_setclock`, :c:func:`clock_nanosleep`
  * Added support for querying the number of bytes available to read via the
    :c:macro:`FIONREAD` request to :c:func:`ioctl`
  * Added :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FDTABLE` to conditionally compile file descriptor table
  * Added logging to POSIX threads, mutexes, and condition variables
  * Fixed :c:func:`poll` issue with event file descriptors

* LoRa/LoRaWAN

  * Updated ``loramac-node`` from v4.6.0 to v4.7.0

* CAN ISO-TP

  * Added support for CAN FD.

* RTIO

  * Added atomic completion counter fixing a race caught by unit tests
  * Added a :c:macro:`RTIO_SQE_NO_RESPONSE` flag for submissions when no completion notification
    is needed
  * Removed unused Kconfig options for different executors

* ZBus

  * Changed channels' and observers' metadata to comply with the data/config approach. ZBus stores
    immutable config in iterable sections in Flash and the mutable portion of data in the RAM.
  * The relationship between channels and observers is mapped using a new entity called
    observation. The observation enables us to increase the granularity of masking observation.
    Developers can mask individual observations, disable the observer, or use runtime observers.
  * Added API :c:macro:`ZBUS_CHAN_ADD_OBS` macro for adding post-definition static observers of a
    channel. That can replace the runtime observer feature, enabling developers to add static
    observers after the channel definition in different files. It increases the composability of
    the system using ZBus, making post-definition channel observation rely on the stack instead of
    the heap.
  * Added a new type of observer called Message Subscriber. ZBus' VDED will send a copy of the
    message during the publication/notification process.
  * Changed the VDED delivery sequence. Check the ref:`documentation<zbus delivery sequence>`.
  * ZBus runtime observers now rely on the heap instead of a memory pool.
  * Added new iterable section iterators APIs (for channels and observers) can now receive a
    ``user_data`` pointer to keep context between the function calls.
  * Added APIs :c:macro:`ZBUS_LISTENER_DEFINE_WITH_ENABLE` and
    :c:macro:`ZBUS_SUBSCRIBER_DEFINE_WITH_ENABLE` that allows developers to define observers'
    statuses (enabled/disabled) programmatically. With the API, developers can create observers
    initially disabled and enable them in runtime.

* Power management

  * Added :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM_NEED_ALL_DEVICES_IDLE`. When this
    option is set the power management will keep the system active
    if there is any device busy.
  * :c:func:`pm_device_runtime_get` can be called from ISR now.
  * Power states can be disabled directly in devicetree doing ``status = "disabled";``
  * Added the helper function, :c:func:`pm_device_driver_init`, for
    initializing devices into a specific power state.

* Modem modules

  * Added the :ref:`modem` subsystem.

HALs
****

* Nordic

  * Updated nrfx to version 3.1.0.

* Nuvoton

  * Added Nuvoton NuMaker M46x

MCUboot
*******

  * Added :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUBOOT_BOOTLOADER_NO_DOWNGRADE`
    that allows to inform application that the on-board MCUboot has been configured
    with downgrade  prevention enabled. This option is automatically selected for
    DirectXIP mode and is available for both swap modes.

  * Added :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUBOOT_BOOTLOADER_MODE_OVERWRITE_ONLY`
    that allows to inform application that the on-board MCUboot will overwrite
    the primary slot with secondary slot contents, without saving the original
    image in primary slot.

  * Fixed issue with serial recovery not showing image details for decrypted images.

  * Fixed issue with serial recovery in single slot mode wrongly iterating over 2 image slots.

  * Fixed an issue with boot_serial repeats not being processed when output was sent, this would
    lead to a divergence of commands whereby later commands being sent would have the previous
    command output sent instead.

  * Fixed an issue with the boot_serial zcbor setup encoder function wrongly including the buffer
    address in the size which caused serial recovery to fail on some platforms.

  * Fixed wrongly building in optimize for debug mode by default, this saves a significant amount
    of flash space.

  * Fixed issue with serial recovery use of MBEDTLS having undefined operations which led to usage
    faults when the secondary slot image was encrypted.

  * Fixed issue with bootutil asserting on maximum alignment in non-swap modes.

  * Added error output when flash device fails to open and asserts are disabled, which will now
    panic the bootloader.

  * Added currently running slot ID and maximum application size to shared data function
    definition.

  * Added P384 and SHA384 support to imgtool.

  * Added optional serial recovery image state and image set state commands.

  * Added ``dumpinfo`` command for signed image parsing in imgtool.

  * Added ``getpubhash`` command to dump the sha256 hash of the public key in imgtool.

  * Added support for ``getpub`` to print the output to a file in imgtool.

  * Added support for dumping the raw versions of the public keys in imgtool.

  * Added support for sharing boot information with application via retention subsystem.

  * Added support for serial recovery to read and handle encrypted seondary slot partitions.

  * Removed ECDSA P224 support.

  * Removed custom image list boot serial extension support.

  * Reworked boot serial extensions so that they can be used by modules or from user repositories
    by switching to iterable sections.

  * Reworked image encryption support for Zephyr, static dummy key files are no longer in the code,
    a pem file must be supplied to extract the private and public keys. The Kconfig menu has
    changed to only show a single option for enabling encryption and selecting the key file.

  * Reworked the ECDSA256 TLV curve agnostic and renamed it to ``ECDSA_SIG``.

  * CDDL auto-generated function code has been replaced with zcbor function calls, this now allows
    the parameters to be supplied in any order.

  * The MCUboot version in this release is version ``2.0.0+0-rc1``.

Nanopb
******

  * Changed project status to maintained.

  * Added a separate nanopb.cmake file to be included by applications.

  * Added helper cmake function ``zephyr_nanopb_sources`` to simplify ``.proto`` file inclusion.

LVGL
****

  * Changed project status to maintained.

  * Library has been updated to release v8.3.7.

  * Added ``zephyr,lvgl-{pointer,button,encoder}-input`` pseudo device bindings.
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LV_Z_KSCAN_POINTER` is still supported but touch controllers
    need a :dtcompatible:`zephyr,kscan-input` child node to emit input events.

  * LVGL shell allows for monkey testing (requires :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LV_USE_MONKEY`)
    and inspecting memory usage.
