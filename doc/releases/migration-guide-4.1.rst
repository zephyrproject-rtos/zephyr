Architectures
*************

* native/POSIX

  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NATIVE_APPLICATION` has been deprecated. Out-of-tree boards using this
    option should migrate to the native_simulator runner (:github:`81232`).
    For an example of how this was done with a board in-tree check :github:`61481`.
  * For the native_sim target :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NATIVE_SIM_NATIVE_POSIX_COMPAT` has been
    switched to ``n`` by default, and this option has been deprecated. Ensure your code does not
    use the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOARD_NATIVE_POSIX` option anymore (:github:`81232`).

* x86

  * Kconfigs ``CONFIG_DISABLE_SSBD`` and ``CONFIG_ENABLE_EXTENDED_IBRS`` have been deprecated
    since v3.7. These were removed.  Use :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_X86_DISABLE_SSBD` and
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_X86_ENABLE_EXTENDED_IBRS` instead.
