Migration guide to Zephyr v4.1.0 (Working Draft)
################################################

This document describes the changes required when migrating your application from Zephyr v4.0.0 to
Zephyr v4.1.0.

Any other changes (not directly related to migrating applications) can be found in
the :ref:`release notes<zephyr_4.1>`.

Mbed TLS
========

* If a platform has a CSPRNG source available (i.e. :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CSPRNG_ENABLED`
  is set), then the Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_EXTERNAL_RNG`
  is the default choice for random number source instead of
  :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_LEGACY_RNG`. This helps in reducing
  ROM/RAM footprint of the Mbed TLS library.

* The newly-added Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_PSA_KEY_SLOT_COUNT`
  allows to specify the number of key slots available in the PSA Crypto core.
  Previously this value was not explicitly set, so Mbed TLS's default value of
  32 was used. The new Kconfig option defaults to 16 instead in order to find
  a reasonable compromise between RAM consumption and most common use cases.
  It can be further trimmed down to reduce RAM consumption if the final
  application doesn't need that many key slots simultaneously.

Trusted Firmware-M
==================

LVGL
====

* The config option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LV_Z_FLUSH_THREAD_PRIO` is now called
  :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LV_Z_FLUSH_THREAD_PRIORITY` and its value is now interpreted as an
  absolute priority instead of a cooperative one.

Architectures
*************

* native/POSIX

  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NATIVE_APPLICATION` has been deprecated. Out-of-tree boards using this
    option should migrate to the native_simulator runner (:github:`81232`).
    For an example of how this was done with a board in-tree check :github:`61481`.
  * For the native_sim target :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NATIVE_SIM_NATIVE_POSIX_COMPAT` has been
    switched to ``n`` by default, and this option has been deprecated. Ensure your code does not
    use the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOARD_NATIVE_POSIX` option anymore (:github:`81232`).
