Information Regarding Maintainers
#################################

Read this information to learn how maintainers review changes using Gerrit.

Once a change is sent to Gerrit for review the maintainers
receive an email requesting them to review the change. The master
branch should never be rebased. Code can be reverted as necessary,
instead of rewriting the history.
