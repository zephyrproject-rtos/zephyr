Rules for Collaboration on an Open Source Mailing List
######################################################

Follow these rules to effectively use the mailing list and get as much
feedback as possible on your work.

* Use the mailing list as much as possible.

* Learn the rules.

* Read the archives if in doubt.

* Choose a meaningful subject line.

* Ask questions and write to the subject matter experts directly and
  CC the mailing list.

* Before doing any large coding work, send a design document with your
  proposed changes to the mailing list. This will save you from losing
  time implementing a solution that the community may reject.

* Write briefly and to the point but give enough context for someone
  to respond without recreating your thought process.

* Be persistent if you are not getting a response but be measured.

* Write a separate email each work item. If they are connected, say so
  in each email.

* Don't rehash old issues.

* Only reply if you can provide new information or a new perspective.
  Avoid "me-too" posts.

* When replying in-line to a mail that was CC'ed to the list, trim out
  unnecessary context between replies and at the end of your mail.

* Do not use capital letters to emphasize a point.

* Make sure your lines are between 72 to 76 characters long.
