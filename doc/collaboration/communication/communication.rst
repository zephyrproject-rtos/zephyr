Communication Tools
###################

Open source is about sharing development information among all contributors
on a given project. Maintainers and contributors have the opportunity to
communicate with each other using open source collaboration tools: the
mailing list, Gerrit and JIRA. We strive to be open about our work with
stakeholders through the community mailing list.

In this spirit, the standard open source community practice is to not send
private feedback through email. Instead, please send feedback to the mailing
list with 'Reply-to-all', and keep the CC list intact. While the mailing list
can be used to hold design discussions, remember to submit all changes using
Gerrit.

The following sections contain information about the communication tools
used with the |project|.
