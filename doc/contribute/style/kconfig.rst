Kconfig Style Guidelines
########################

  * Line length of 100 columns or fewer.
  * Indent with tabs, except for ``help`` entry text which should be placed at
    one tab plus two extra spaces.
  * Leave a single empty line between option declarations.
  * Use Statements like ``select`` carefully, see
    :ref:`kconfig_tips_and_tricks` for more information.
  * Format comments as ``# Comment`` rather than ``#Comment``
  * Insert an empty line before/after each top-level ``if`` and ``endif``
    statement.
