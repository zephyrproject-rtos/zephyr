Devicetree Style Guidelines
###########################

  * Indent with tabs.
  * Follow the Devicetree specification conventions and rules.
  * Use dashes (``-``) as word separators for node and property names.
  * Use underscores (``_``) as word separators in node labels.
  * Leave a single space on each side of the equal sign (``=``) in property
    definitions.
  * Don't insert empty lines before a dedenting ``};``.
  * Insert a single empty line to separate nodes at the same hierarchy level.
