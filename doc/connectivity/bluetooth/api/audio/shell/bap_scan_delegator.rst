Bluetooth: Broadcast Audio Profile Scan Delegator
#################################################

This document describes how to run the Scan Delegator functionality, Note that
in the examples below, some lines of debug have been
removed to make this shorter and provide a better overview.

The Scan Delegator may optionally support the periodic advertisements
synchronization transfer (PAST) protocol.

The Scan Delegator server typically resides on devices that have inputs or
outputs.

It is necessary to have
:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_BAP_SCAN_DELEGATOR_LOG_LEVEL_DBG` enabled for using
the Scan Delegator interactively.

The Scan Delegator can currently only set the sync state of a receive state, but
does not actually support syncing with periodic advertisements yet.
