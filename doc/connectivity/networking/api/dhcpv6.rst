Overview
********

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for IPv6 is a network management protocol
used on IPv6 based networks. A DHCPv6 server dynamically assigns an IPv6 address
and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network so they
can communicate with other IP networks.
See this
`DHCPv6 Wikipedia article <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHCPv6>`_
for a detailed overview of how DHCPv6 works.

Note that Zephyr only supports DHCPv6 client functionality.
