Overview
********

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol
used on IPv4 networks. A DHCPv4 server dynamically assigns an IPv4 address
and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network so they
can communicate with other IP networks.
See this
`DHCP Wikipedia article <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol>`_
for a detailed overview of how DHCP works.

Note that Zephyr supports both DHCPv4 client and server functionality.
