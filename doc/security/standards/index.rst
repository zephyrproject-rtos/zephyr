Security standards and Zephyr
#############################

Historically, organizations managed cybersecurity independently, defining their own assessment and
response protocols. Today, governments are increasingly regulating this area through new mandates
and security standards. These standards define specific guidelines and compliance requirements for
connected products.

This section evaluates the implications of these security standards for the Zephyr project itself,
as well as downstream product developers. The goal is to provide developers with the information
needed to build certifiable, compliant products using Zephyr.
