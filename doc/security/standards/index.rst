Security standards and Zephyr
#############################

For a long period organizations were, more or less, left responsible to deal
with cyber security on their own. This included how to assess the scale and impact
of the problem and who to properly respond it.

Now, governments started looking how to regulate it and several regulations
and enforcements are rapidly emerging, and consequently, security standards. These
standards provide guidelines and outline requirements that products have to follow
to achieve compliance.

This section aims to identify and assess which Zephyr project components are impacted
by security standards requirements and provide the right information to enable
organizations developing certifiable products using Zephyr project.
