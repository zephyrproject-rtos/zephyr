ETSI 303-645
############


`ETSI EN 303 645`, also known as "Cyber Security for Consumer Internet
of Things: Baseline Requirements," is a standard developed by the
European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).

The standard includes provisions for secure software updates, data
protection, secure communication, and the minimization of exposed
attack surfaces, among other things. It is part of a broader effort to
address the challenges and risks associated with IoT devices.

Full version of the standard can be found `here <https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/303600_303699/303645/02.01.01_60/en_303645v020101p.pdf>`_.

    * - authentication value
      - individual value of an attribute used by an authentication mechanism.

        the security of a security module.

    * - debug interface
