Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``dragino_lsn50`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

Dragino LSN50  board requires an external debugger.

Flashing an application to Dragino LSN50
----------------------------------------

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

Connect the Dragino LSN50 to a STLinkV2 to your host computer using the USB port, then
run a serial host program to connect with your board. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

Then build and flash the application:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: dragino_lsn50
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   $ Hello World! arm

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: dragino_lsn50
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
