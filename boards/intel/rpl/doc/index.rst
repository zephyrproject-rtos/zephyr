Raptor Lake CRB
###############

Overview
********
Raptor Lake processor is a 13th generation 64-bit multi-core processor built
on a 10-nanometer technology process. Raptor Lake is based on a Hybrid
architecture, utilizing P-cores for performance and E-Cores for efficiency.

Raptor Lake S and Raptor Lake P processor lines are supported.

The S-Processor line is a 2-Chip Platform that includes the Processor Die and
Platform Controller Hub (PCH-S) Die in the Package.

The P-Processor line is a 2-Die Multi Chip Package (MCP) that includes the
Processor Die and Platform Controller Hub (PCH-P) Die on the same package as
the Processor Die.

For more information about Raptor Lake Processor lines, P-cores, and E-cores
please refer to `RPL`_.

Raptor Lake Customer Reference Board (RPL CRB) is an example implementation of a
compact single board computer with high performance for IoT edge devices. The
supported boards are `intel_rpl_s_crb` and `intel_rpl_p_crb`.

These board configurations enable kernel support for the supported Raptor Lake
boards.

Build Zephyr application
========================

#. Build a Zephyr application; for instance, to build the ``hello_world``
   application on Raptor Lake S CRB:

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
      :board: intel_rpl_s_crb
      :goals: build

   .. note::

      A Zephyr EFI image file named :file:`zephyr.efi` is automatically
      created in the build directory after the application is built.
