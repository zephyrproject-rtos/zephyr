Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

Bluetooth and STM32WB Copro Wireless Binaries
==============================================

**IMPORTANT**: The WeAct STM32WB55 Core Board ships with a "Full Stack" wireless
binary pre-installed on the Cortex-M0+ coprocessor. This binary is **NOT compatible**
with Zephyr and must be replaced with an "HCI Layer" binary before using Bluetooth
functionality.

To operate Bluetooth on the WeAct STM32WB55 Core Board, the Cortex-M0+ core must
be flashed with a valid STM32WB Coprocessor HCI binary. These binaries are delivered
in STM32WB Cube packages, under ``Projects/STM32WB_Copro_Wireless_Binaries/STM32WB5x/``

For this board, the extended HCI binary has been tested: ``stm32wb5x_BLE_HCILayer_extended_fw.bin``

For compatibility information with the various versions of these binaries,
please check :module_file:`hal_stm32:lib/stm32wb/README.rst`.

Flashing the Wireless Coprocessor Binary
-----------------------------------------

The Cortex-M0+ wireless coprocessor binary **requires an external debug probe** and
STM32CubeProgrammer to flash. DFU mode cannot be used for the M0+ coprocessor.
Connect an external debug probe (ST-LINK/V2 or J-Link) to the 4-pin SWD
header (P3) and use STM32CubeProgrammer to program the binary at the appropriate
memory address.

The install address for STM32WB5xxG (1M variant) varies by binary type (v1.23.0):

- BLE_HCILayer_extended: 0x080DB000
- BLE_HCILayer: 0x080E1000

FUS (Firmware Upgrade Services) install address (v2.1.0):

- FUS v2.1.0: 0x080EE000


See the `STM32 Wireless Coprocessor Binary Table`_ for complete address information.

Connections and IOs
===================

Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------

- UART_1 TX/RX : PA9/PA10
- LPUART_1 TX/RX : PA2/PA3 (with CTS: PA6, RTS: PB1)
- I2C_1_SCL : PB8
- I2C_1_SDA : PB9

System Clock
------------

The WeAct STM32WB55 Core Board system clock is driven by a 32 MHz HSE crystal
oscillator. By default, the system clock is configured to run at 64 MHz using
the PLL with HSE as the source.

Power Supply
------------

The board includes an ME6231A33M3G 3.3V LDO regulator that accepts input voltage
from 3.3V to 5.5V. Power can be supplied via:

- USB Type-C connector (5V)
- VDD5V pins on header P1
- VDD33 pins on header P2 (3.3V regulated supply)

Serial Port
-----------

The board has 1 USART and 1 LPUART. The Zephyr console output is assigned to
USART1 (PA9/PA10). Default settings are 115200 8N1.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

.. zephyr:board-supported-runners::

The WeAct STM32WB55 Core Board does not include an onboard debugger.
The Cortex-M4 can be flashed via DFU mode without an external probe, however
the Cortex-M0+ coprocessor requires an external debug probe (ST-LINK/V2 or J-Link)
connected to the 4-pin SWD header (P3).

Flashing
========

Installing dfu-util
-------------------

It is recommended to use at least v0.8 of `dfu-util`_. The package available in
debian/ubuntu can be quite old, so you might have to build dfu-util from source.
There is also a Windows version which works, but you may have to install the
right USB drivers with a tool like `Zadig`_.

Flashing an Application
-----------------------

Connect a USB Type-C cable and the board should power ON. Force the board into DFU mode
by keeping the BOOT button pressed while pressing and releasing the RESET button.

The dfu-util runner is supported on this board and so a sample can be built and
tested easily.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: weact_stm32wb55_core
   :goals: build flash

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: weact_stm32wb55_core
   :goals: build flash

Alternatively, if you have an external debug probe (ST-LINK/V2 or J-Link)
connected to the SWD header (P3), STM32CubeProgrammer can also be used to flash the
Cortex-M4 application using the ``--runner`` (or ``-r``) option:

.. code-block:: console

   $ west flash --runner stm32cubeprogrammer

Debugging
=========

You need an external debugger connected to the SWD header (P3) to debug
applications on this board. You can then debug an application in the usual way.
Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application.
