The default configuration per core can be found in the defconfig file:
:zephyr_file:`boards/weact/stm32h5_core/weact_stm32h5_core_defconfig`

Pin Mapping
===========

Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------

The ``weact_stm32h5_core`` board is configured as follows

- USER_LED : PB2
- USER_PB : PC13
- SDMMC1 CLK/DCMD/CD/D0/D1/D2/D3 : PC12/PD2/PD4/PC8/PC9/PC10/PC11 (microSD card)
- USB DM/DP : PA11/PA12 (USB CDC ACM)
- UART on debug header : RX/TX - pA10/PA9

System Clock
============

The STM32H562RG System Clock can be driven by an internal or external oscillator,
as well as by the main PLL clock. By default, the System clock is driven
by the PLL clock at 240MHz. PLL clock is fed by a 8MHz external clock.

Serial Port (USB CDC ACM)
=========================

The Zephyr console output is assigned to the USB CDC ACM virtual serial port.
Virtual COM port interface. Default communication settings are 115200 8N1.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

The ``weact_stm32h5_core`` board facilitates firmware flashing via the USB DFU
bootloader. This method simplifies the process of updating images, although
it doesn't provide debugging capabilities. However, the board provides header
pins for the Serial Wire Debug (SWD) interface, which can be used to connect
an external debugger, such as ST-Link.

Flashing
========

To activate the bootloader, follow these steps:

1. Press and hold the BOOT0 key.
2. While still holding the BOOT0 key, press and release the RESET key.
3. Wait for 0.5 seconds, then release the BOOT0 key.

Upon successful execution of these steps, the device will transition into
bootloader mode and present itself as a USB DFU Mode device. You can program
the device using the west tool or the STM32CubeProgrammer.

Flashing an application to ``weact_stm32h5_core``
-------------------------------------------------

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

First, put the board in bootloader mode as described above. Then build and flash
the application in the usual way. Just add ``CONFIG_BOOT_DELAY=5000`` to the
configuration, so that USB CDC ACM is initialized before any text is printed,
as below:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: weact_stm32h5_core
   :goals: build flash
   :gen-args: -DCONFIG_BOOT_DELAY=5000

Run a serial host program to connect with your board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D <tty_device> -b 115200

Then, press the RESET button, you should see the following message after few seconds:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! weact_stm32h5_core

Replace :code:`<tty_device>` with the port where the board can be found.
For example, under Linux, :code:`/dev/ttyACM0`.

Debugging
---------

This current Zephyr port does not support debugging.

Testing the LEDs in the ``weact_stm32h5_core``
**********************************************

There is a sample that allows to test that LED on the board are working
properly with Zephyr:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: weact_stm32h5_core
   :goals: build flash
   :gen-args: -DCONFIG_BOOT_DELAY=5000

You can build and flash the examples to make sure Zephyr is running correctly on
your board. The LED definitions can be found in
:zephyr_file:`boards/weact/stm32h5_core/weact_stm32h5_core.dts`.

Testing shell over USB in the ``weact_stm32h5_core``
****************************************************

There is a sample that allows to test shell interface over USB CDC ACM interface
with Zephyr:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/subsys/shell/shell_module
   :board: weact_stm32h5_core
   :goals: build flash
   :gen-args: -DCONFIG_BOOT_DELAY=5000
