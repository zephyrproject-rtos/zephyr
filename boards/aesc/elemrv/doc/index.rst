.. zephyr:board:: elemrv

Overview
********

ElemRV-N is an end-to-end open-source RISC-V microcontroller designed using SpinalHDL.

Version 0.2 of ElemRV-N was successfully fabricated using `IHP's Open PDK`_, a 130nm open semiconductor process, with support from `FMD-QNC`_.

For more details, refer to the official `GitHub Project`_.

.. note::
   The currently supported silicon version is ElemRV-N 0.2.

Supported Features
******************

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

System Clock
============

The system clock for the RISC-V core is set to 20 MHz. This value is specified in the ``cpu0`` devicetree node using the ``clock-frequency`` property.

CPU
===

ElemRV-N integrates a VexRiscv RISC-V core featuring a 5-stage pipeline and the following ISA extensions:

* M (Integer Multiply/Divide)
* C (Compressed Instructions)

It also includes the following general-purpose ``Z`` extensions:

* Zicntr – Base Counter and Timer extensions
* Zicsr – Control and Status Register operations
* Zifencei – Instruction-fetch fence

The complete ISA string for this CPU is: ``RV32IMC_Zicntr_Zicsr_Zifencei``

Hart-Level Interrupt Controller (HLIC)
======================================

Each CPU core is equipped with a Hart-Level Interrupt Controller, configurable through Control and Status Registers (CSRs).

Machine Timer
=============

A RISC-V compliant machine timer is enabled by default.

Serial
======

The UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) interface is a configurable serial communication peripheral used for transmitting and receiving data.

By default, ``uart0`` operates at a baud rate of ``115200``, which can be adjusted via the elemrv device tree.

To evaluate the UART interface, build and run the following sample:
