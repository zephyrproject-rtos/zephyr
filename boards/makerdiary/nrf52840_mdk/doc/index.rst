********

The nRF52840-MDK is a versatile, easy-to-use IoT hardware platform for
Bluetooth 5, Bluetooth Mesh, Thread, IEEE 802.15.4, ANT and 2.4GHz proprietary
applications using the nRF52840 SoC.

The development kit comes with a fully integrated debugger (also known as
DAPLink) that provides USB drag-and-drop programming, USB Virtual COM port
and CMSIS-DAP interface.

The kit contains a Microchip USB 2.0 Hi-Speed hub controller with two downstream
ports: one for DAPLink interface and one for nRF52840 USB device controller.
The kit also features ultra-low power 64-Mb QSPI FLASH memory, programmable
user button, RGB LED, up to 24 GPIOs, antenna selection for custom applications.

See `nRF52840-mdk website`_ for more information about the development
board and `nRF52840 website`_ for the official reference on the IC itself.
