.. zephyr:board:: npcx4m8f_evb

Overview
********

The NPCX4M8F_EVB kit is a development platform to evaluate the
Nuvoton NPCX4 series microcontrollers. This board needs to be mated with
part number NPCX498F.

Hardware
********

- ARM Cortex-M4F Processor
- 512 KB RAM and 64 KB boot ROM
- ADC & GPIO headers
- UART0 and UART1
- FAN PWM interface
- Jtag interface
- Intel Modular Embedded Controller Card (MECC) headers

Supported Features
==================

Connections and IOs
===================

Nuvoton to provide the schematic for this board.

System Clock
============

The NPCX4M8F MCU is configured to use the 120Mhz internal oscillator with the
on-chip PLL to generate a resulting EC clock rate of 15 MHz. See Processor clock
control register (chapter 4 in user manual)

Serial Port
===========

UART1 is configured for serial logs.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

This board comes with a Cortex ETM port which facilitates tracing and debugging
using a single physical connection. In addition, it comes with sockets for
JTAG-only sessions.

Flashing
========

If the correct headers are installed, this board supports both J-TAG and also
the ChromiumOS servo.

To flash using Servo V2, Î¼Servo, or Servo V4 (CCD), see the
`Chromium EC Flashing Documentation`_ for more information.

To flash with J-TAG, install the drivers for your programmer, for example:
SEGGER J-link's drivers are at https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/

The openocd from Zephyr SDK 0.16.1 doesn't include npcx4 support, so build openocd from source.::

  sudo apt-get install libftdi-dev libusb-1.0.0-dev
  git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/openocd/code ~/openocd
  cd ~/openocd
  ./bootstrap
  ./configure --enable-jlink --enable-ftdi
  make clean
  make
  sudo make install

Build and flash the blinky sample.::

  west build -t clean && \
    west build -c -p auto -b npcx4m8f_evb samples/basic/blinky && \
    west flash --openocd /usr/local/bin/openocd

Debugging
=========

Use JTAG/SWD with a J-Link
