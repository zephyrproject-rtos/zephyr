Overview
********

The NuMaker PFM M467 is an Internet of Things (IoT) application focused platform
specially developed by Nuvoton. The PFM-M467 is based on the NuMicro速 M467
Ethernet series MCU with ARM速 -Cortex速-M4F core.

Features:
=========
- 32-bit Arm Cortex速-M4 M467HJHAE MCU
- Core clock up to 200 MHz
- 1024 KB embedded Dual Bank Flash and 512 KB SRAM
- Ethernet (IP101GR) for network application
- USB 2.0 High-Speed OTG / Host / Device
- USB 1.1 Full-Speed OTG / Host / Device
- External SPI Flash (Winbond W25Q20) which can be regarded as ROM module
- MicroSD Card slot for T-Flash
- Arduino UNO compatible interface
- Three push-buttons: one is for reset and the other two are for user-defined
- Four LEDs: one is for power indication and the other three are for user-defined
- On-board NU-Link2 ICE debugger/programmer with SWD connector

More information about the board can be found at the `PFM M467 User Manual`_.

Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

The on-board 12-MHz crystal allows the device to run at its maximum operating speed of 200MHz.

More details about the supported peripherals are available in `M460 TRM`_

Building and Flashing
*********************
Flashing
========

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

On board debugger Nu-link2 can emulate UART0 as a virtual COM port over usb,
To enable this, set ISW1 DIP switch 1-3 (TXD RXD VOM) to ON.
Connect the PFM M467 IoT to your host computer using the USB port, then
run a serial host program to connect with your board. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: numaker_pfm_m467
   :goals: flash

Debugging
=========

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: numaker_pfm_m467
   :goals: debug

Step through the application in your debugger.
