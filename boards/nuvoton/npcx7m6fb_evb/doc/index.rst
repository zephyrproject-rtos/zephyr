Other hardware features are not currently supported by Zephyr (at the moment)

The default configuration can be found in the defconfig file:
:zephyr_file:`boards/nuvoton/npcx7m6fb_evb/npcx7m6fb_evb_defconfig`


Connections and IOs
===================

Nuvoton to provide the schematic for this board.

System Clock
============

The NPCX7M6FB MCU is configured to use the 90Mhz internal oscillator with the
on-chip PLL to generate a resulting EC clock rate of 15 MHz. See Processor clock
control register (chapter 4 in user manual)

Serial Port
===========

UART1 is configured for serial logs.


Programming and Debugging
*************************

This board comes with a Cortex ETM port which facilitates tracing and debugging
using a single physical connection.  In addition, it comes with sockets for
JTAG only sessions.

Flashing
========

If the correct IDC headers are installed, this board supports both J-TAG and
also the ChromiumOS servo.

To flash using Servo V2, Î¼Servo, or Servo V4 (CCD), see the
`Chromium EC Flashing Documentation`_ for more information.

To flash with J-TAG, install the drivers for your programmer, for example:
SEGGER J-link's drivers are at https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/

   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: npcx7m6fb_evb
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: build flash

Debugging
=========

Use JTAG/SWD with a J-Link
