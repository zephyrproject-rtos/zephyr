.. zephyr:board:: npcx7m6fb_evb

Overview
********

The NPCX7M6FB_EVB kit is a development platform to evaluate the
Nuvoton NPCX7 series microcontrollers. This board needs to be mated with
part number NPCX796FB.

Hardware
********

- ARM Cortex-M4F Processor
- 256 KB RAM and 64 KB boot ROM
- ADC & GPIO headers
- UART0 and UART1
- FAN PWM interface
- Jtag interface
- Intel Modular Embedded Controller Card (MECC) headers

Supported Features

Connections and IOs
===================

Nuvoton to provide the schematic for this board.

System Clock
============

The NPCX7M6FB MCU is configured to use the 90Mhz internal oscillator with the
on-chip PLL to generate a resulting EC clock rate of 15 MHz. See Processor clock
control register (chapter 4 in user manual)

Serial Port
===========

UART1 is configured for serial logs.


Programming and Debugging
*************************

This board comes with a Cortex ETM port which facilitates tracing and debugging
using a single physical connection.  In addition, it comes with sockets for
JTAG only sessions.

Flashing
========

If the correct IDC headers are installed, this board supports both J-TAG and
also the ChromiumOS servo.

To flash using Servo V2, Î¼Servo, or Servo V4 (CCD), see the
`Chromium EC Flashing Documentation`_ for more information.

To flash with J-TAG, install the drivers for your programmer, for example:
SEGGER J-link's drivers are at https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/
