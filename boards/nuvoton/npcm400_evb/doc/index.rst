Connections and IOs
===================

Nuvoton to provide the schematic for this board.

Serial Port
===========

UART0 is configured for serial logs. The default serial setup is 115200 8N1.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

This board comes with a Cortex ETM port which facilitates tracing and debugging
using a single physical connection. In addition, it comes with sockets for
JTAG-only sessions.

Flashing
========

If the correct headers are installed, this board supports J-TAG.

To flash with J-TAG, install the drivers for your programmer, for example:
SEGGER J-link's drivers are at https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
    :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
    :board: npcm400_evb
    :goals: flash

Open a serial terminal, and you should see the following message in the terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    Hello World! npcm400_evb/npcm400

Debugging
=========

Use JTAG/SWD with a J-Link
