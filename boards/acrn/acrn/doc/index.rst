ACRN hypervisor
###############

Zephyr's is capable of running as a guest under the x86 ACRN
hypervisor (see https://projectacrn.org/).  The process for getting
this to work is somewhat involved, however.

ACRN hypervisor supports a hybrid scenario where Zephyr runs in a so-
called "pre-launched" mode. This means Zephyr will access the ACRN
hypervisor directly without involving the SOS VM. This is the most
practical user scenario in the real world because Zephyr's real-time
and safety capability can be assured without influence from other
VMs. The following figure from ACRN's official documentation shows
how a hybrid scenario works:

    ACRN Hybrid User Scenario

In this tutorial, we will show you how to build a minimal running instance of Zephyr
and ACRN hypervisor to demonstrate that it works successfully. To learn more about
other features of ACRN, such as building and using the SOS VM or other guest VMs,
please refer to the Getting Started Guide for ACRN:
https://projectacrn.github.io/latest/tutorials/using_hybrid_mode_on_nuc.html

Build your Zephyr App
*********************

First, build the Zephyr application you want to run in ACRN as you
normally would, selecting an appropriate board:

    .. code-block:: console

        west build -b acrn_ehl_crb samples/hello_world

In this tutorial, we will use the Intel Elkhart Lake Reference Board
(`EHL`_ CRB) since it is one of the suggested platforms for this
type of scenario. Use ``acrn_ehl_crb`` as the target board parameter.

Note the kconfig output in ``build/zephyr/.config``, you will need to
reference that to configure ACRN later.

The Zephyr build artifact you will need is ``build/zephyr/zephyr.bin``,
which is a raw memory image.  Unlike other x86 targets, you do not
want to use ``zephyr.elf``!

Configure and build ACRN
************************

First you need the source code, clone from:

    .. code-block:: console

        git clone https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor

We suggest that you use versions v2.5.1 or later of the ACRN hypervisor
as they have better support for SMP in Zephyr.

Like Zephyr, ACRN favors build-time configuration management instead
of runtime probing or control.  Unlike Zephyr, ACRN has single large
configuration files instead of small easily-merged configuration
elements like kconfig defconfig files or devicetree includes.  You
have to edit a big XML file to match your Zephyr configuration.
Choose an ACRN host config that matches your hardware ("ehl-crb-b" in
this case).  Then find the relevant file in
``misc/config_tools/data/<platform>/hybrid.xml``.

First, find the list of ``<vm>`` declarations.  Each has an ``id=``
attribute.  For testing Zephyr, you will want to make sure that the
Zephyr image is ID zero.  This allows you to launch ACRN with just one
VM image and avoids the need to needlessly copy large Linux blobs into
the boot filesystem.  Under currently tested configurations, Zephyr
will always have a "vm_type" tag of "SAFETY_VM".

Configure Zephyr Memory Layout
==============================

Next, locate the load address of the Zephyr image and its entry point
address.  These have to be configured manually in ACRN.  Traditionally
Zephyr distributes itself as an ELF image where these addresses can be
automatically extracted, but ACRN does not know how to do that, it
only knows how to load a single contiguous region of data into memory
and jump to a specific address.

Find the "<vm id="0">...<os_config>" tag that will look something like this:

    .. code-block:: xml

        <os_config>
            <name>Zephyr</name>
            <kern_type>KERNEL_ZEPHYR</kern_type>
            <kern_mod>Zephyr_RawImage</kern_mod>
            <ramdisk_mod/>
            <bootargs></bootargs>
            <kern_load_addr>0x1000</kern_load_addr>
            <kern_entry_addr>0x1000</kern_entry_addr>
        </os_config>

The ``kern_load_addr`` tag must match the Zephyr LOCORE_BASE symbol
found in include/arch/x86/memory.ld.  This is currently 0x1000 and
matches the default ACRN config.

The ``kern_entry_addr`` tag must match the entry point in the built
``zephyr.elf`` file.  You can find this with binutils, for example:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ objdump -f build/zephyr/zephyr.elf

        build/zephyr/zephyr.elf:     file format elf64-x86-64
        architecture: i386:x86-64, flags 0x00000012:
        EXEC_P, HAS_SYMS
        start address 0x0000000000001000

By default this entry address is the same, at 0x1000.  This has not
always been true of all configurations, however, and will likely
change in the future.

Configure Zephyr CPUs
=====================

Now you need to configure the CPU environment ACRN presents to the
guest.  By default Zephyr builds in SMP mode, but ACRN's default
configuration gives it only one CPU.  Find the value of
``CONFIG_MP_MAX_NUM_CPUS`` in the Zephyr .config file give the guest that
many CPUs in the ``<cpu_affinity>`` tag.  For example:

    .. code-block:: xml

        <vm id="0">
            <vm_type>SAFETY_VM</vm_type>
            <name>ACRN PRE-LAUNCHED VM0</name>
            <guest_flags>
                <guest_flag>0</guest_flag>
            </guest_flags>
            <cpu_affinity>
                <pcpu_id>0</pcpu_id>
                <pcpu_id>1</pcpu_id>
            </cpu_affinity>
            ...
            <clos>
                <vcpu_clos>0</vcpu_clos>
                <vcpu_clos>0</vcpu_clos>
            </clos>
            ...
        </vm>

To use SMP, we have to change the pcpu_id of VM0 to 0 and 1.
This configures ACRN to run Zephyr on CPU0 and CPU1. The ACRN hypervisor
and Zephyr application will not boot successfully without this change.
If you plan to run Zephyr with one CPU only, you can skip it.

Since Zephyr is using CPU0 and CPU1, we also have to change
VM1's configuration so it runs on CPU2 and CPU3. If your ACRN setup has
additional VMs, you should change their configurations as well.

    .. code-block:: xml

        <vm id="1">
            <vm_type>SOS_VM</vm_type>
            <name>ACRN SOS VM</name>
            <guest_flags>
                <guest_flag>0</guest_flag>
            </guest_flags>
            <cpu_affinity>
                <pcpu_id>2</pcpu_id>
                <pcpu_id>3</pcpu_id>
            </cpu_affinity>
            <clos>
                <vcpu_clos>0</vcpu_clos>
                <vcpu_clos>0</vcpu_clos>
            </clos>
            ...
        </vm>

Note that these indexes are physical CPUs on the host.  When
configuring multiple guests, you probably don't want to overlap these
assignments with other guests.  But for testing Zephyr simply using
CPUs 0 and 1 works fine.  (Note that ehl-crb-b has four physical CPUs,
so configuring all of 0-3 will work fine too, but leave no space for
other guests to have dedicated CPUs).

Build ACRN
==========

Once configuration is complete, ACRN builds fairly cleanly:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ make -j BOARD=ehl-crb-b SCENARIO=hybrid

The only build artifact you need is the ACRN multiboot image in
``build/hypervisor/acrn.bin``

Assemble EFI Boot Media
***********************

ACRN will boot on the hardware via the GNU GRUB bootloader, which is
itself launched from the EFI firmware.  These need to be configured
correctly.

Locate GRUB
===========

First, you will need a GRUB EFI binary that corresponds to your
hardware.  In many cases, a simple upstream build from source or a
copy from a friendly Linux distribution will work.  In some cases it
will not, however, and GRUB will need to be specially patched for
specific hardware.  Contact your hardware support team (pause for
laughter) for clear instructions for how to build a working GRUB.  In
practice you may just need to ask around and copy a binary from the
last test that worked for someone.

Create EFI Boot Filesystem
==========================

Now attach your boot media (e.g. a USB stick on /dev/sdb, your
hardware may differ!) to a Linux system and create an EFI boot
partition (type code 0xEF) large enough to store your boot artifacts.
This command feeds the relevant commands to fdisk directly, but you
can type them yourself if you like:

    .. code-block:: console

        # for i in n p 1 "" "" t ef w; do echo $i; done | fdisk /dev/sdb
        ...
        <lots of fdisk output>

Now create a FAT filesystem in the new partition and mount it:

    .. code-block:: console

        # mkfs.vfat -n ACRN_ZEPHYR /dev/sdb1
        # mkdir -p /mnt/acrn
        # mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/acrn

Copy Images and Configure GRUB
==============================

ACRN does not have access to a runtime filesystem of its own.  It
receives its guest VMs (i.e. zephyr.bin) as GRUB "multiboot" modules.
This means that we must rely on GRUB's filesystem driver.  The three
files (GRUB, ACRN and Zephyr) all need to be copied into the
"/efi/boot" directory of the boot media.  Note that GRUB must be named
"bootx64.efi" for the firmware to recognize it as the bootloader:

    .. code-block:: console

        # mkdir -p /mnt/acrn/efi/boot
        # cp $PATH_TO_GRUB_BINARY /mnt/acrn/efi/boot/bootx64.efi
        # cp $ZEPHYR_BASE/build/zephyr/zephyr.bin /mnt/acrn/efi/boot/
        # cp $PATH_TO_ACRN/build/hypervisor/acrn.bin /mnt/acrn/efi/boot/

At boot, GRUB will load a "efi/boot/grub.cfg" file for its runtime
configuration instructions (a feature, ironically, that both ACRN and
Zephyr lack!).  This needs to load acrn.bin as the boot target and
pass it the zephyr.bin file as its first module (because Zephyr was
configured as ``<vm id="0">`` above).  This minimal configuration will
work fine for all but the weirdest hardware (i.e. "hd0" is virtually
always the boot filesystem from which grub loaded), no need to fiddle
with GRUB plugins or menus or timeouts:

    .. code-block:: console

        # cat > /mnt/acrn/efi/boot/grub.cfg<<EOF
        set root='hd0,msdos1'
        multiboot2 /efi/boot/acrn.bin
        module2 /efi/boot/zephyr.bin Zephyr_RawImage
        boot
        EOF

Now the filesystem should be complete

    .. code-block:: console

        # umount /dev/sdb1
        # sync

Boot ACRN
*********

If all goes well, booting your EFI media on the hardware will result
in a running ACRN, a running Zephyr (because by default Zephyr is
configured as a "prelaunched" VM), and a working ACRN command line on
the console.

You can see the Zephyr (vm 0) console output with the "vm_console"
command:

    .. code-block:: console

        ACRN:\>vm_console 0

        ----- Entering VM 0 Shell -----
