Overview
********

The `EFR32xG26 Explorer Kit`_ is a small form factor development and evaluation platform based on
the `EFR32MG26 SoC`_. The Explorer Kit is focused on rapid prototyping and concept creating of IoT
applications for 2.4 GHz wireless protocols including Bluetooth LE, Bluetooth mesh, Zigbee, Thread,
and Matter.

Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

System Clock
============

The EFR32MG26 SoC is configured to use the HFRCODPLL oscillator at 78 MHz as the system clock,
locked to the 39 MHz crystal oscillator on the board.

Serial Port
===========

The EFR32MG26 SoC has 3 USARTs and 4 EUSARTs.
USART0 is connected to the board controller and is used for the console.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

.. zephyr:board-supported-runners::

Flashing
========

Connect the Explorer Kit to your host computer using the USB port.

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: xg26_ek2709a
   :goals: flash

Open a serial terminal (minicom, putty, etc.) with the following settings:

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1

Reset the board and you should see the following message in the terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! xg26_ek2709a

Bluetooth
=========

To use Bluetooth functionality, run the command below to retrieve necessary binary
blobs from the Silicon Labs HAL repository.

.. code-block:: console

   west blobs fetch hal_silabs

Then build the Zephyr kernel and a Bluetooth sample with the following
command. The :zephyr:code-sample:`bluetooth_observer` sample application is used in
this example.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/bluetooth/observer
   :board: xg26_ek2709a
   :goals: build
