Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

System Clock
============

The EFM32PG26 MCU is configured to use the HFRCODPLL oscillator at 78 MHz as the system clock,
locked to the 39 MHz crystal oscillator on the board.

Serial Port
===========

The EFM32PG26 MCU has 3 USARTs and 4 EUSARTs.
USART0 is connected to the board controller and is used for the console.

Programming and Debugging

Flashing
========

Connect the Explorer Kit to your host computer using the USB port.

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: pg26_ek2711a
   :goals: flash

Open a serial terminal (minicom, putty, etc.) with the following settings:

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1

Reset the board and you should see the following message in the terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! pg26_ek2711a
