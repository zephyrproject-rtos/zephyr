Overview
********

The BGM220 Explorer Kit is a small form factor development and evaluation platform for the BGM220P
Bluetooth Module.

The kit features a USB interface, an on-board SEGGER J-Link debugger, one user-LED and button, and
support for hardware add-on boards via a mikroBus socket and a Qwiic connector.

Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

System Clock
============

The system is configured to use the HFRCODPLL oscillator at 76.8 MHz as the system
clock, locked to the 38.4 MHz crystal oscillator in the module.

Serial Port
===========

The BGM220P module has two USARTs and one EUART.
USART1 is connected to the board controller and is used for the console.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

.. zephyr:board-supported-runners::

.. note::
   Before using the kit the first time, you should update the J-Link firmware
   in Simplicity Studio.

Flashing
========

The sample application :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` is used for this example.
Build the Zephyr kernel and application:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: bgm220_ek4314a
   :goals: build

Connect the board to your host computer using the USB port and you
should see a USB connection.

Open a serial terminal (minicom, putty, etc.) with the following settings:

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1

Reset the board and you'll see the following message on the corresponding serial port
terminal session:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! bgm220_ek4314a/bgm220pc22hna

Bluetooth
=========

To use BLE functionality, run the command below to retrieve necessary binary
blobs from the Silicon Labs HAL repository.

.. code-block:: console

   west blobs fetch hal_silabs

Then build the Zephyr kernel and a Bluetooth sample with the following
command. The :zephyr:code-sample:`bluetooth_observer` sample application is used in
this example.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/bluetooth/observer
   :board: bgm220_ek4314a
   :goals: build
