Flashing
========

The xG27 Dev Kit includes an embedded `J-Link`_ adapter built around
EFM32GG12 microcontroller (not user-programmable).
The adapter provides:

- SWD interface to EFR32BG27 for flashing and debugging.
- SWO trace interface to EFR32BG27 for tracing.
- UART interface to EFR32BG27 for console access.
- A USB connection to the host computer, which exposes CDC-ACM Serial Port
  endpoints for access to the console UART interface and proprietary J-Link
  endpoints for access to the SWD and SWO interfaces.

UART functionality of the adapter is accessible via standard CDC-ACM USB driver
present in most desktop operating systems and any standard serial port terminal
program e.g. `picocom`_.

SWD and SWO functionality is accessible via `Simplicity Commander`_.

The simplest way to flash the board is by using West, which runs Simplicity
Commander in unattended mode and passes all the necessary arguments to it.

- If Simplicity Commander is installed in the system and the directory in
  which `commander` executable is located is present in the `PATH` environment
  variable:

  .. code-block:: console

   west flash

- Otherwise, one should specify full path to the `commander` executable:

  .. code-block:: console

   west flash --commander <path_to_commander_directory>/commander

- In case several J-Link adapters are connected, you must specify serial number
  of the adapter which should be used for flashing:

  .. code-block:: console

   west flash --dev-id <J-Link serial number>

Programming and Debugging
=========================

The sample application :ref:`hello_world` is used for this example.
Build the Zephyr kernel and application:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: xg27_dk2602a
   :goals: build

Connect your device to your host computer using the USB port and you
should see a USB connection. Use `west`'s flash command

Open a serial terminal (minicom, putty, etc.) with the following settings:

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1

Reset the board and you should be able to see on the corresponding Serial Port
the following message:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! xg27_dk2602a
