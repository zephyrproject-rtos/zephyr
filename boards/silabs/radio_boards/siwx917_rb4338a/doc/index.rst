Overview
********

The SiWx917-RB4338A (aka BRD4338A) radio board provides support for the Silicon
Labs SiWG917 SoC. This board cannot be used stand-alone and requires a a
`Wireless Pro Kit`_ Mainboard (Si-MB4002A aka BRD4002A), for power, debug
options etc.

This board might be sold as a part of the `SiWx917-PK6031A`_ bundle ("SiWx917
Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth LE 8 MB Flash Pro Kit"), which includes the BRD4002A
Mainboard in addition of the BRD4338A.

SiWG917 is an ultra-low power SoC that includes hardware support for Single-Band
Wi-Fi 6 + Bluetooth LE 5.4, Matter...

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Flashing
========

Applications for the ``siwx917_rb4338a`` board can be built in the usual
way. The flash method requires on `Simplicity Commander`_ installed on the host.

Then, connect the BRD4002A board with a mounted BRD4338A radio module to your
host computer using the USB port.

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: siwx917_rb4338a
   :goals: flash

Open a serial terminal (minicom, putty, etc.) with the following settings:

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1

Reset the board and you should see the following message in the terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! siwx917_rb4338a


Debugging
=========

Debuggning relies on JLink tool. JLink is not able to flash the firmware. So
debug session has to be done in two steps. ``west flash`` will flahs the
firmware using Simplicity Commander. Then ``west attach`` will use JLink to
attach to the board. The Zephyr image may has already booted when user runs
``west attach``. User may execute ``monitor reset`` in the gdb prompt to reset
the board.
