Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

System Clock
============

The BGM220 module is configured to use the HFRCODPLL oscillator at 76.8 MHz as the system
clock, locked to the 38.4 MHz external crystal oscillator on the board.

Serial Port
===========

The BGM220 module has two USARTs and one EUART.
USART1 is connected to the board controller and is used for the console.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

.. zephyr:board-supported-runners ::

Connect the BRD4001A mainboard with a mounted BRD4311A radio board to your host
computer using the USB port.

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: slwrb4311a
   :goals: flash

Open a serial terminal (minicom, putty, etc.) with the following settings:

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1

Reset the board and you should see the following message in the terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! slwrb4311a

Bluetooth
=========

To use Bluetooth functionality, run the command below to retrieve necessary binary
blobs from the Silicon Labs HAL repository.

.. code-block:: console

   west blobs fetch hal_silabs

Then build the Zephyr kernel and a Bluetooth sample with the following
command. The :zephyr:code-sample:`bluetooth_observer` sample application is used in
this example.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/bluetooth/observer
   :board: slwrb4311a
   :goals: build
