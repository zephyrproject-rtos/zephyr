Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``xg29_rb4412a`` board target can be built, flashed, and debugged in the
usual way. See :ref:`build_an_application` and :ref:`application_run` for more details on
building and running.

Flashing
========

As an example, this section shows how to build and flash the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world`
application.

To build and program the sample to the xG24-RB4412A, complete the following steps:

First, plug the xG24-RB4412A to a compatible mainboard and connect the mainboard to your computer
using the USB port on the left side.
Next, build and flash the sample by running the following command:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: xg29_rb4412a
   :goals: build flash

``west flash`` will by default use SEGGER JLink. Make sure that the JLinkExe binary is available on
the PATH. Alternatively, use ``west flash -r silabs_commander`` to use Simplicity Commander to flash.
In this case, make sure that the commander binary is available on PATH.

Open a serial terminal (minicom, putty, etc.) with the following settings:

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1

Reset the board and you should see the following message in the terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! xg29_rb4412a

Bluetooth
=========

To use the BLE function, run the command below to retrieve necessary binary
blobs from the SiLabs HAL repository.

.. code-block:: console

   west blobs fetch hal_silabs

Then build the Zephyr kernel and a Bluetooth sample with the following
command. The :zephyr:code-sample:`bluetooth_observer` sample application is used in
this example.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/bluetooth/observer
   :board: xg29_rb4412a
   :goals: build
