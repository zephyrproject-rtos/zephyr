STM32F030 DEMO BOARD
####################

This board has the bare minimum components required to power on
the STM32F030F4P6 MCU. Most of the GPIOs on the STM32 SoC have
been exposed in the external headers with silk screen labels
that match the SoC's pin names.

For practical use, you'll need to add additional components
and circuits using a breadboard, for example.

===========

Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------

- UART_1 TX/RX : PA9/PA10
- LED : PA4

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``stm32f030_demo`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

The board can be flashed by using ST-LINKV2 in-circuit debugger and programmer.
This interface is supported by the openocd version included in the Zephyr SDK.

Flashing an application to STM32F030 DEMO BOARD
-----------------------------------------------

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: stm32f030_demo
   :goals: build flash

You will see the LED blinking every second.

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way. Here is an example for the
:zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: stm32f030_demo
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
