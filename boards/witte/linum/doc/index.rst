System Clock
------------

Linum H753ZI System Clock could be driven by an internal or external
oscillator, as well as the main PLL clock. By default, the System clock is
driven by the PLL clock at 480MHz, driven by an 25MHz high-speed external clock.


Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``linum`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

.. note::

  For debugging or programming Linum you will need to use an external debug
  debug or flash tool and connect it to the SWD Connnector. JLink or ST-Link
  probes are examples of out of the box compatible tools.

Flashing
========

Flashing an application to the Linum board
-------------------------------------------

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

Run a serial host program to connect with your Nucleo board.

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -b 115200 -D /dev/ttyACM0

Build and flash the application:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: linum
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   $ Hello World! linum

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: linum
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
