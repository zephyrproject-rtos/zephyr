Supported Features
==================

The following features are supported:

+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+
| Interface | Controller | Driver/Component                    |
+===========+============+=====================================+
| NVIC      | on-chip    | nested vector interrupt controller  |
+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+
| UART      | on-chip    | serial port-polling;                |
|           |            | serial port-interrupt               |
+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+

Other hardware features are not currently supported by Zephyr (at the moment)

The default configuration can be found in
:zephyr_file:`boards/aspeed/ast1030_evb/ast1030_evb_defconfig`


Connections and IOs
===================

Aspeed to provide the schematic for this board.

System Clock
============

The AST1030 SOC is configured to use external 25MHz clock input to generate 200Mhz system clock by
the on-chip PLL.

Serial Port
===========

UART5 is configured for serial logs.  The default serial setup is 115200 8N1.


Programming and Debugging
*************************

This board comes with a JTAG port which facilitates debugging using a single physical connection.

Flashing
========

Build application as usual for the ``ast1030_evb`` board, and flash
using SF100 SPI Flash programmer. See the
`Aspeed Zephyr SDK User Guide`_ for more information.


Debugging
=========

Use JTAG or SWD with a J-Link
