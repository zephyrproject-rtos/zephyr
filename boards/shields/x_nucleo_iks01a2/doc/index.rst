X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2: MEMS Inertial and Environmental Multi sensor shield
#####################################################################

Overview
********
The X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 is a motion MEMS and environmental sensor expansion board
for the STM32 Nucleo. It is equipped with Arduino UNO R3 connector layout, and
is designed around the LSM6DSL 3D accelerometer and 3D gyroscope, the LSM303AGR
3D accelerometer and 3D magnetometer, the HTS221 humidity and temperature sensor
and the LPS22HB pressure sensor.

The X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 interfaces with the STM32 microcontroller via the I2C pin,
and it is possible to change the default I2C port.

Hardware Configuration
**********************

X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 board connects the various devices on two separate I2C bus:

- LSM6DL is on I2C2
- LSM303AGR, LPS22HB, HTS221 are on I2C1

X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 board can be configured in two different ways: Mode 1 and Mode 2


Mode 1: Standard Mode
=====================

In standard I2C mode the two buses are connected together. As a consequence, all devices on the shield
reside on the same I2C bus and are accessible from the main board through I2C bus.

The jumper configuration to activate this mode is:

- JP7 => 1-2, 3-4 (I2C1 = I2C2, I2Cx=GND)
- JP8 => 1-2, 3-4 (I2C1 = I2C2, I2Cx=GND)


Mode 2: SensorHub Mode
======================

In SensorHub mode LSM6DSL is connected to I2C2 and is accessible from the main board.
All the other devices are connected to LSM6DSL master through I2C1.

The jumper configuration to activate this mode is:

- JP7 => 2-3 (I2C1 = I2Cx)
- JP8 => 2-3 (I2C1 = I2Cx)

More information about X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 configuration modes can be found in the
`X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 databrief`_


Programming
***********

Two samples are provided as examples for ``x-nucleo-iks01a2`` shield:

- :zephyr:code-sample:`x-nucleo-iks01a2-std` sample application, to be used when the shield is configured
  in Standard Mode
- :zephyr:code-sample:`x-nucleo-iks01a2-shub` sample application, to be used when the shield is configured
  in SensorHub Mode
