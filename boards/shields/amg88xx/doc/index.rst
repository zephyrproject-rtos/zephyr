Panasonic Grid-EYE Shields
##########################

Overview
********

The Panasonic Grid-EYE is an infra-red sensor, which is comprised of 64
individual thermopile elements arranged in an 8x8 matrix.

The sensor comes in a compact surface mount package and can be very easily
integrated into thermometry applications.

Grid-EYE is available in different varieties which differ in field of view,
amplification factor and operating voltages. For example AMG8833 features a 60
degree field of view, a high gain amplification factor and 3.3V operating
voltage.

For the different part numbers that follow the AMG88xx scheme please refer to
`IR Thermophile Array Sensor - Grid-EYE`_.

For sensor evaluation and rapid prototyping multiple shields are available:

- `Panasonic Grid-EYE Evaluation Shield`_

Please note that the former follows the Arduino shield standard, while the
latter is a breakout board only. Please use the ``amg88xx_grid_eye_eval_shield``
Grid-EYE shield designation for these boards.

For the Panasonic Grid-EYE sensor an older evaluation kit was available, that
also could be used as an Arduino shield.

- Panasonic Grid-EYE Evaluation Kit

Please note that this evaluation kit is no longer available and no online
documentation is available anymore. Please use the ``amg88xx_eval_kit``
Grid-EYE shield designation for this board instead.

Requirements
************

These shields can only be used with a board that has Arduino connectors and
where node aliases for I2C and GPIO interfaces are correctly defined in the
board's device tree.

This is true for example for Panasonic's PAN1780/PAN1770, PAN1781 and PAN1782
evaluation boards (`Panasonic Wireless Connectivity Development Hub`_).

Jumper Configuration
********************

Panasonic Grid-EYE Evaluation Shield
====================================

The Grid-EYE sensor is powered using a LDO. Make sure to set a jumper on
P10: LDO_EN.

A jumper on P11 configures the I2C address selection.

When you use the ``amg88xx_grid_eye_eval_shield`` Grid-EYE shield designation
make sure to use the following jumper configurations:

* P10: LDO_EN
* P11: AD 0x68

Panasonic Grid-EYE Evaluation Kit
=================================

On the AMG88xx Evaluation Kit, all jumpers except the J11 and J14 must be
removed.

Pin Assignment
**************

Panasonic Grid-EYE Evaluation Shield
====================================

The following table shows the complete pin assignment of the Grid-EYE
Evaluation Shield.

+---------------------------+-----------------+
| Shield Connector Pin      | Function        |
+===========================+=================+
| D2                        | Interrupt       |
+---------------------------+-----------------+
| D14                       | I2C SDA         |
+---------------------------+-----------------+
| D15                       | I2C SCL         |
+---------------------------+-----------------+
| Power supply header pin 5 | 5V Power Supply |
+---------------------------+-----------------+
| Power supply header pin 6 | GND             |
+---------------------------+-----------------+
| Power supply header pin 7 | GND             |
+---------------------------+-----------------+

For more detailed information please refer to
`Panasonic Grid-EYE Evaluation Shield`_.

For the `Adafruit AMG8833 8x8 Thermal Camera Sensor`_ breakout board you can
use the ``amg88xx_grid_eye_eval_shield`` shield designation as well.

The wiring has to be done according to
`Adafruit AMG8833 8x8 Thermal Camera Sensor Pinouts`_ and the pin assignment
table mentioned above.

Panasonic Grid-EYE Evaluation Kit
=================================

The following table shows the complete pin assignment of the Grid-EYE
Evaluation Kit.

| Shield Connector Pin      | Function        |
+===========================+=================+
| D6                        | Interrupt       |
+---------------------------+-----------------+
| D14                       | I2C SDA         |
+---------------------------+-----------------+
| D15                       | I2C SCL         |
+---------------------------+-----------------+

Building
********

The ``samples/sensor/amg88xx`` application demonstrates the basic usage of the
Panasonic Grid-EYE sensor.

If you want to build the application you have to use the
``--shield amg88xx_grid_eye_eval_shield`` shield designation accordingly when
you invoke ``west build``.

When using the PAN1780 evaluation board the build invocation looks like this:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/sensor/amg88xx
   :board: pan1780_evb
   :shield: amg88xx_grid_eye_eval_shield
   :goals: build
