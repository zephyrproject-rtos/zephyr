Programming and Debugging
*************************

Flashing
========

Build and flash applications as usual (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

The easiest way to flash Zephyr onto a RuuviTag requires an external Ruuvi DEVKIT. More information about the board can be found at the
`ruuvitag devkit`_.

Once your tag is connected to the DEVKIT and connected to your PC, build and flash the application in the usual way.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: ruuvi_ruuvitag
   :goals: build flash

Advanced users may want to program the RuuviTag without the DEVKIT, this can be achieved via the SWDIO and SWDCLK pins located on the back of the RuuviTag.

Debugging
=========

If using the Ruuvi DEVKIT refer to the :ref:`nordic_segger` page to learn about debugging Nordic boards with a
Segger IC.

Testing the LEDs and buttons on the RuuviTag
********************************************

There are 2 samples that allow you to test that the buttons (switches) and LEDs on
the board are working properly with Zephyr:

* :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky`
* :zephyr:code-sample:`button`

You can build and flash the examples to make sure Zephyr is running correctly on
your board. The button and LED definitions can be found in :file:`boards/ruuvi//ruuvi_ruuvitag/ruuvi_ruuvitag.dts`.
