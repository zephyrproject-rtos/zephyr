	  The Apollo510B GPU has limited access to MRAM. If this option is
	  enabled, large constant assets (like LVGL fonts and images) will
	  be loaded into MRAM but copied to external XIP RAM at BOARD_LATE_INIT_HOOK
	  for direct access by the GPU. This is essential for any LVGL
	  application with large assets on this board.
