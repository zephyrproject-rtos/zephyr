Overview
********

ESP32 is a series of low cost, low power system on a chip microcontrollers
with integrated Wi-Fi & dual-mode Bluetooth. The ESP32 series employs a
Tensilica Xtensa LX6 microprocessor in both dual-core and single-core
variations. ESP32 is created and developed by Espressif Systems, a
Shanghai-based Chinese company, and is manufactured by TSMC using their 40nm
process. For more information, check `ESP32-DevKitC`_.

The features include the following:

- Dual core Xtensa microprocessor (LX6), running at 160 or 240MHz
- 520KB of SRAM
- 802.11b/g/n/e/i
- Bluetooth v4.2 BR/EDR and BLE
- Various peripherals:

  - 12-bit ADC with up to 18 channels
  - 2x 8-bit DACs
  - 10x touch sensors
  - Temperature sensor
  - 4x SPI
  - 2x I2S
  - 2x I2C
  - 3x UART
  - SD/SDIO/MMC host
  - Slave (SDIO/SPI)
  - Ethernet MAC
  - CAN bus 2.0
  - IR (RX/TX)
  - Motor PWM
  - LED PWM with up to 16 channels
  - Hall effect sensor

- Cryptographic hardware acceleration (RNG, ECC, RSA, SHA-2, AES)
- 5uA deep sleep current

For more information, check the datasheet at `ESP32 Datasheet`_ or the technical reference
manual at `ESP32 Technical Reference Manual`_.

Asymmetric Multiprocessing (AMP)
********************************

ESP32-DevKitC-WROVER allows 2 different applications to be executed in ESP32 SoC. Due to its dual-core architecture, each core can be enabled to execute customized tasks in stand-alone mode
and/or exchanging data over OpenAMP framework. See :zephyr:code-sample-category:`ipc` folder as code reference.

Supported Features

System Requirements
*******************

Espressif HAL requires WiFi and Bluetooth binary blobs in order work. Run the command
below to retrieve those files.

.. code-block:: console

   west blobs fetch hal_espressif

.. note::

   It is recommended running the command above after :file:`west update`.

Programming and Debugging

Debugging
=========

ESP32 support on OpenOCD is available at `OpenOCD ESP32`_.

On the ESP32-DevKitC board, the JTAG pins are not run to a
standard connector (e.g. ARM 20-pin) and need to be manually connected
to the external programmer (e.g. a Flyswatter2):

+------------+-----------+
| ESP32 pin  | JTAG pin  |
+============+===========+
| 3V3        | VTRef     |
+------------+-----------+
| EN         | nTRST     |
+------------+-----------+
| IO14       | TMS       |
+------------+-----------+
| IO12       | TDI       |
+------------+-----------+
| GND        | GND       |
+------------+-----------+
| IO13       | TCK       |
+------------+-----------+
| IO15       | TDO       |
+------------+-----------+

Further documentation can be obtained from the SoC vendor in `JTAG debugging for ESP32`_.

Here is an example for building the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: esp32_devkitc/esp32/procpu
   :goals: build flash

You can debug an application in the usual way. Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: esp32_devkitc/esp32/procpu
   :goals: debug

Note on Debugging with GDB Stub
===============================

GDB stub is enabled on ESP32.

* When adding breakpoints, please use hardware breakpoints with command
  ``hbreak``. Command ``break`` uses software breakpoints which requires
  modifying memory content to insert break/trap instructions.
  This does not work as the code is on flash which cannot be randomly
  accessed for modification.
