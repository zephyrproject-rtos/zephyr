Overview
********

ESP32 is a series of low cost, low power system on a chip microcontrollers
with integrated Wi-Fi & dual-mode Bluetooth. The ESP32 series employs a
Tensilica Xtensa LX6 microprocessor in both dual-core and single-core
variations. ESP32 is created and developed by Espressif Systems, a
Shanghai-based Chinese company, and is manufactured by TSMC using their 40nm
process. For more information, check `ESP32-DevKitC`_.

On the ESP32-DevKitC board, the JTAG pins are not run to a
standard connector (e.g. ARM 20-pin) and need to be manually connected
to the external programmer (e.g. a Flyswatter2):
