Overview
********

ESP32-C6-DevKitC is an entry-level development board based on ESP32-C6-WROOM-1(U),
a general-purpose module with a 8 MB SPI flash. This board integrates complete Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth LE, Zigbee, and Thread functions. For more information, check `ESP32-C6-DevKitC`_.

Hardware
********

ESP32-C6 is Espressif's first Wi-Fi 6 SoC integrating 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3 (LE) and the
802.15.4 protocol. ESP32-C6 achieves an industry-leading RF performance, with reliable security
features and multiple memory resources for IoT products.
It consists of a high-performance (HP) 32-bit RISC-V processor, which can be clocked up to 160 MHz,
and a low-power (LP) 32-bit RISC-V processor, which can be clocked up to 20 MHz.
It has a 320KB ROM, a 512KB SRAM, and works with external flash.

ESP32-C6-DevKitC is an entry-level development board based on ESP32-C6-WROOM-1(U),
a general-purpose module with a 8 MB SPI flash.

Most of the I/O pins are broken out to the pin headers on both sides for easy interfacing.
Developers can either connect peripherals with jumper wires or mount ESP32-C6-DevKitC on
a breadboard.

Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

System requirements
*******************

Espressif HAL requires WiFi and Bluetooth binary blobs in order work. Run the command
below to retrieve those files.

.. code-block:: console

   west blobs fetch hal_espressif

.. note::

   It is recommended running the command above after :file:`west update`.

Building and Flashing
*********************

Low-Power CPU (LP CORE)
***********************

The ESP32-C6 SoC has two RISC-V cores: the High-Performance Core (HP CORE) and the Low-Power Core (LP CORE).
The LP Core features ultra low power consumption, an interrupt controller, a debug module and a system bus
interface for memory and peripheral access.

The LP Core is in sleep mode by default. It has two application scenarios:

- Power insensitive scenario: When the High-Performance CPU (HP Core) is active, the LP Core can assist the HP CPU with some speed and efficiency-insensitive controls and computations.
- Power sensitive scenario: When the HP CPU is in the power-down state to save power, the LP Core can be woken up to handle some external wake-up events.

For more information, check the datasheet at `ESP32-C6 Datasheet`_ or the technical reference
manual at `ESP32-C6 Technical Reference Manual`_.

The LP Core support is fully integrated with :ref:`sysbuild`. The user can enable the LP Core by adding
the following configuration to the project:

.. code:: cfg

   CONFIG_ULP_COPROC_ENABLED=y

See :zephyr:code-sample-category:`lp-core` folder as code reference.
