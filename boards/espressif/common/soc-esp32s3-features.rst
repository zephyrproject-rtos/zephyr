ESP32-S3 Features
=================

ESP32-S3 is a low-power MCU-based system on a chip (SoC) with integrated 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth® Low Energy (Bluetooth LE). It consists of high-performance dual-core microprocessor
(Xtensa® 32-bit LX7), a low power coprocessor, a Wi-Fi baseband, a Bluetooth LE baseband,
RF module, and numerous peripherals.

ESP32-S3 SoC includes the following features:

- Dual core 32-bit Xtensa Microprocessor (Tensilica LX7), running up to 240MHz
- Additional vector instructions support for AI acceleration
- 512KB of SRAM
- 384KB of ROM
- Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n
- Bluetooth LE 5.0 with long-range support and up to 2Mbps data rate

Digital interfaces:

- 45 programmable GPIOs
- 4x SPI
- 1x LCD interface (8-bit ~16-bit parallel RGB, I8080 and MOTO6800), supporting conversion between RGB565, YUV422, YUV420 and YUV411
- 1x DVP 8-bit ~16-bit camera interface
- 3x UART
- 2x I2C
- 2x I2S
- 1x RMT (TX/RX)

- General DMA controller (GDMA), with 5 transmit channels and 5 receive channels
- 1x TWAI® controller, compatible with ISO 11898-1 (CAN Specification 2.0)
- Addressable RGB LED, driven by GPIO38.

Analog interfaces:

- 2x 12-bit SAR ADCs, up to 20 channels
- 1x temperature sensor
- 14x touch sensing IOs

Timers:

- 4x 54-bit general-purpose timers
- 1x 52-bit system timer
- 3x watchdog timers

Low Power:

- Power Management Unit with five power modes
- Ultra-Low-Power (ULP) coprocessors: ULP-RISC-V and ULP-FSM

Security:

- Secure boot
- Flash encryption
- 4-Kbit OTP, up to 1792 bits for users
- Cryptographic hardware acceleration: (AES-128/256, Hash, RSA, RNG, HMAC, Digital signature)

Asymmetric Multiprocessing (AMP)
================================

Boards featuring the ESP32-S3 SoC allows 2 different applications to be executed. Due to its dual-core
architecture, each core can be enabled to execute customized tasks in stand-alone mode
and/or exchanging data over OpenAMP framework. See :zephyr:code-sample-category:`ipc` folder as code reference.
