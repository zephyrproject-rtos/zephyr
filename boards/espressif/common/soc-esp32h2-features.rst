ESP32-H2 Features
=================

ESP32-H2 combines IEEE 802.15.4 connectivity with Bluetooth 5 (LE). The SoC is powered by
a single-core, 32-bit RISC-V microcontroller that can be clocked up to 96 MHz. The ESP32-H2 has
been designed to ensure low power consumption and security for connected devices. ESP32-H2 has
320 KB of SRAM with 16 KB of Cache, 128 KB of ROM, 4 KB LP of memory, and a built-in 2 MB or 4 MB
SiP flash. It has 19 programmable GPIOs with support for ADC, SPI, UART, I2C, I2S, RMT, GDMA
and LED PWM.
