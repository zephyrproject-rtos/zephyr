.. zephyr:board:: esp32c3_devkitc

Overview
********

ESP32-C3-DevKitC-02 is an entry-level development board based on ESP32-C3-WROOM-02,
a general-purpose module with 4 MB SPI flash. This board integrates complete Wi-Fi and Bluetooth® Low Energy functions.
For more information, check `ESP32-C3-DevKitC`_.

Hardware
********

ESP32-C3 is a single-core Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5 (LE) microcontroller SoC,
based on the open-source RISC-V architecture. It strikes the right balance of power,
I/O capabilities and security, thus offering the optimal cost-effective
solution for connected devices.
The availability of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5 (LE) connectivity not only makes the device configuration easy,
but it also facilitates a variety of use-cases based on dual connectivity.

The features include the following:

- 32-bit core RISC-V microcontroller with a maximum clock speed of 160 MHz
- 400 KB of internal RAM
- 802.11b/g/n/e/i
- A Bluetooth LE subsystem that supports features of Bluetooth 5 and Bluetooth Mesh
- Various peripherals:

  - 12-bit ADC with up to 6 channels
  - TWAI compatible with CAN bus 2.0
  - Temperature sensor
  - 3x SPI
  - 1x I2S
  - 1x I2C
  - 2x UART
  - LED PWM with up to 6 channels

- Cryptographic hardware acceleration (RNG, ECC, RSA, SHA-2, AES)

For more information, check the datasheet at `ESP32-C3 Datasheet`_ or the technical reference
manual at `ESP32-C3 Technical Reference Manual`_.
