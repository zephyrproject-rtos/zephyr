Overview
********

The ESP32-S3-DevKitM is an entry-level development board equipped with either ESP32-S3-MINI-1
or ESP32-S3-MINI-1U, a module named for its small size. This board integrates complete Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth Low Energy functions. For more information, check `ESP32-S3-DevKitM User Guide`_.

Hardware
********

ESP32-S3 is a low-power MCU-based system on a chip (SoC) with integrated 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth® Low Energy (Bluetooth LE). It consists of high-performance dual-core microprocessor

- 1x TWAI® controller, compatible with ISO 11898-1 (CAN Specification 2.0)
- Addressable RGB LED, driven by GPIO48.

Analog interfaces:

- 2x 12-bit SAR ADCs, up to 20 channels
- 1x temperature sensor
- 14x touch sensing IOs

Timers:

- 4x 54-bit general-purpose timers
- 1x 52-bit system timer
- 3x watchdog timers

Low Power:

- Flash encryption
- 4-Kbit OTP, up to 1792 bits for users
- Cryptographic hardware acceleration: (AES-128/256, Hash, RSA, RNG, HMAC, Digital signature)

Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

Asymmetric Multiprocessing (AMP)
********************************

ESP32S3-DevKitM allows 2 different applications to be executed in ESP32-S3 SoC. Due to its dual-core
architecture, each core can be enabled to execute customized tasks in stand-alone mode
and/or exchanging data over OpenAMP framework. See :zephyr:code-sample-category:`ipc` folder as code reference.

For more information, check the datasheet at `ESP32-S3 Datasheet`_ or the technical reference
manual at `ESP32-S3 Technical Reference Manual`_.

System requirements
*******************

Espressif HAL requires WiFi and Bluetooth binary blobs in order work. Run the command
below to retrieve those files.

.. code-block:: console

   west blobs fetch hal_espressif

.. note::

   It is recommended running the command above after :file:`west update`.
