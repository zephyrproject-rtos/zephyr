.. zephyr:board:: esp32s3_eye

Overview
********

The ESP32-S3-EYE is a small-sized AI development board produced by [Espressif](https://espressif.com).
It is based on the [ESP32-S3](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s3) SoC.
It features a 2-Megapixel camera, an LCD display, and a microphone, which are used for image
recognition and audio processing. ESP32-S3-EYE offers plenty of storage, with an 8 MB Octal PSRAM
and a 8 MB flash.

Hardware
********

The ESP32-S3-EYE board consists of two parts: the main board (ESP32-S3-EYE-MB) that integrates the
ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 module, camera, SD card slot, digital microphone, USB port, and function buttons;
and the sub board (ESP32-S3-EYE-SUB) that contains an LCD display.
The main board and sub board are connected through pin headers.

     - The LED (green) turns on when USB power is connected to the board. If it is not turned on, it indicates either the USB power is not supplied, or the 5 V to 3.3 V LDO is broken. Software can configure GPIO3 to set different LED statuses (turned on/off, flashing) for different statuses of the board. Note that GPIO3 must be set up in open-drain mode. Pulling GPIO3 up may burn the LED.

Prerequisites
*************

Espressif HAL requires WiFi and Bluetooth binary blobs in order work. Run the command
below to retrieve those files.

.. code-block:: console

   west blobs fetch hal_espressif

.. note::

   It is recommended running the command above after :file:`west update`.

Building & Flashing
*******************

Simple boot
-----------

The board could be loaded using the single binary image, without 2nd stage bootloader.
It is the default option when building the application without additional configuration.

.. note::

   Simple boot does not provide any security features nor OTA updates.

MCUboot bootloader
------------------

User may choose to use MCUboot bootloader instead. In that case the bootloader
must be built (and flashed) at least once.

There are two options to be used when building an application:

1. Sysbuild
2. Manual build

.. note::

   User can select the MCUboot bootloader by adding the following line
   to the board default configuration file.

   .. code:: cfg

      CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT=y

Sysbuild
--------

The sysbuild makes possible to build and flash all necessary images needed to
bootstrap the board with the ESP32 SoC.

To build the sample application using sysbuild use the command:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :tool: west
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: esp32s3_eye/esp32s3/procpu
   :goals: build
   :west-args: --sysbuild
   :compact:

By default, the ESP32 sysbuild creates bootloader (MCUboot) and application
images. But it can be configured to create other kind of images.

Build directory structure created by sysbuild is different from traditional
Zephyr build. Output is structured by the domain subdirectories:

.. code-block::

  build/
  ├── hello_world
  │   └── zephyr
  │       ├── zephyr.elf
  │       └── zephyr.bin
  ├── mcuboot
  │    └── zephyr
  │       ├── zephyr.elf
  │       └── zephyr.bin
  └── domains.yaml

.. note::

   With ``--sysbuild`` option the bootloader will be re-build and re-flash
   every time the pristine build is used.

For more information about the system build please read the :ref:`sysbuild` documentation.

Manual build
------------

During the development cycle, it is intended to build & flash as quickly possible.
For that reason, images can be built one at a time using traditional build.

The instructions following are relevant for both manual build and sysbuild.
The only difference is the structure of the build directory.

.. note::

   Remember that bootloader (MCUboot) needs to be flash at least once.

Build and flash applications as usual (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: esp32s3_eye/esp32s3/procpu
   :goals: build

The usual ``flash`` target will work with the ``esp32s3_eye/esp32s3/procpu`` board
configuration. Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world`
application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: esp32s3_eye/esp32s3/procpu
   :goals: flash

Open the serial monitor using the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   west espressif monitor

After the board has automatically reset and booted, you should see the following
message in the monitor:

.. code-block:: console

   ***** Booting Zephyr OS vx.x.x-xxx-gxxxxxxxxxxxx *****
   Hello World! esp32s3_eye/esp32s3/procpu

Debugging
*********

ESP32-S3 modules require patches to OpenOCD that are not upstreamed yet.
Espressif maintains their own fork of the project. The custom OpenOCD can be obtained at
`OpenOCD ESP32`_

The Zephyr SDK uses a bundled version of OpenOCD by default.
You can overwrite that behavior by adding the
``-DOPENOCD=<path/to/bin/openocd> -DOPENOCD_DEFAULT_PATH=<path/to/openocd/share/openocd/scripts>``
parameter when building.

Here is an example for building the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: esp32s3_eye/esp32s3/procpu
   :goals: build flash
   :gen-args: -DOPENOCD=<path/to/bin/openocd> -DOPENOCD_DEFAULT_PATH=<path/to/openocd/share/openocd/scripts>

You can debug an application in the usual way. Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world`
application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: esp32s3_eye/esp32s3/procpu
   :goals: debug
