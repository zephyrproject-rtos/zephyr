.. note::
	Most Arduino interfaces are supported. Arduino pins
	D5 and D8 are not available, so arduino_gpio is
	disabled. On the EVK-NINA-B1, these pins are
	assigned to SWDIO and SWDCLK, respectively.

Other hardware features have not been enabled yet for this board.
See `EVK-NINA-B1 product page`_ and `NINA-B1 Data Sheet`_
for a complete list of EVK NINA-B1 hardware features.

Connections and IOs
===================

LED
---

* LED0 (red) = P0.08
* LED1 (green) = P0.16
* LED2 (blue) = P0.18

Push buttons
------------

* BUTTON1 = SW1 = P0.16
* BUTTON2 = SW2 = P0.30


General information on module pin numbering
-------------------------------------------

The numbering of the pins on the module and EVK do not follow the GPIO
numbering on the nRF52832 SoC. Please see the `NINA-B1 Data Sheet`_ for
information on how to map NINA-B1 pins to the pin numbering on the
nRF52832 SoC.

The reason for this is the u-blox module family concept where different
modules share the same pinout and can be interchanged, see
`NINA module family Nested design`_.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``ubx_evkninab1/nrf52832`` board configuration can be
built and flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application`
and :ref:`application_run` for more details); however, the standard
debugging targets are not currently available.

Flashing
========

Build and flash applications as usual (see
:ref:`build_an_application` and :ref:`application_run` for more details).

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

Open a terminal program to the USB Serial Port installed when connecting
the board and listen for output.

Settings: 115200, 8N1, no flow control.

Then build and flash the application in the usual way.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: ubx_evkninab1/nrf52832
   :goals: build flash

Debugging
=========

Refer to the :ref:`nordic_segger` page to learn about debugging boards
containing a Nordic Semiconductor chip with a Segger IC.


Testing the LEDs and buttons in the EVK NINA-B11x
*************************************************

There are 2 samples that allow you to test that the buttons (switches)
and LEDs on the board are working properly with Zephyr:

.. code-block:: console

   samples/basic/blinky
   samples/basic/button

You can build and flash the examples to make sure Zephyr is running
correctly on your board. The button and LED definitions can be found in
:zephyr_file:`boards/u-blox/ubx_evkninab1/ubx_evkninab1_nrf52832.dts`.

Note that the buttons on the EVK-NINA-B1 are marked SW1 and SW2, which
are named sw0 and sw1 in the dts file.
Also note that the SW1 button and the green LED are connected on HW level.
