Other hardware features are not currently supported by Zephyr.

The default configuration can be found in the Kconfig
:zephyr_file:`boards/atmel/sam/sam_v71_xult/sam_v71_xult_samv71q21_defconfig`.

Connections and IOs
===================

The `SAMV71-XULT User Guide`_ has detailed information about board
connections.

System Clock
============

The SAM V71 MCU is configured to use the 12 MHz external oscillator on the
board with the on-chip PLL to generate a 300 MHz system clock.

Serial Port
===========

The ATSAMV71Q21 MCU has five UARTs and three USARTs. USART1 is configured
for the console and is available as a Virtual COM Port via EDBG USB chip.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Flashing the Zephyr project onto SAM V71 MCU requires the `OpenOCD tool`_.
By default a factory new SAM V71 chip will boot the `SAM-BA`_ boot loader
located in the ROM, not the flashed image. This is determined by the value
of GPNVM1 (General-Purpose NVM bit 1). The flash procedure will ensure that
GPNVM1 is set to 1 changing the default behavior to boot from Flash.

If your chip has a security bit GPNVM0 set you will be unable to program flash
memory or connect to it via a debug interface. The only way to clear GPNVM0
is to perform a chip erase procedure that will erase all GPNVM bits and the
full contents of the SAM V71 flash memory:

- With the board power off, set a jumper on the J200 header.
- Turn the board power on. The jumper can be removed soon after the power is
  on (flash erasing procedure is started when the erase line is asserted for
  at least 230ms)

Flashing
========

#. Run your favorite terminal program to listen for output. Under Linux the
   terminal should be :code:`/dev/ttyACM0`. For example:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0 -o

   The -o option tells minicom not to send the modem initialization
   string. Connection should be configured as follows:

   - Speed: 115200
   - Data: 8 bits
   - Parity: None
   - Stop bits: 1

#. Connect the SAM V71 Xplained Ultra board to your host computer using the
   USB debug port. Then build and flash the :ref:`hello_world`
   application.

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
      :board: sam_v71_xult/samv71q21
      :goals: build flash

   You should see "Hello World! sam_v71_xult" in your terminal.

#. To use the SoC variation B IC, you need type "sam_v71_xult/samv71q21b".

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
      :board: sam_v71_xult/samv71q21b
      :goals: build flash

   You should see "Hello World! sam_v71_xult" in your terminal.

You can flash the image using an external debug adapter such as J-Link
or ULINK, connected to the 20-pin JTAG header. Supply the name of the
debug adapter (e.g., ``jlink``) via an OPENOCD_INTERFACE environment
variable. OpenOCD will look for the appropriate interface
configuration in an ``interface/$(OPENOCD_INTERFACE).cfg`` file on its
internal search path.

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: sam_v71_xult/samv71q21
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
