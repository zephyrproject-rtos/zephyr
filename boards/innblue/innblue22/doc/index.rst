Connections and IOs
===================

LED
---

* LED1 ( red ) = P0.7
* LED2 (green) = P0.6
* LED3 ( blue) = P0.5
* LED4 ( red ) = P0.4

Push buttons and Switches
-------------------------

* BUTTON1 = P0.31

Security components
===================

- Implementation Defined Attribution Unit. The IDAU is implemented
  with the System Protection Unit and is used to define secure and non-secure
  memory maps.  By default, all of the memory space  (Flash, SRAM, and
  peripheral address space) is defined to be secure accessible only.
- Secure boot.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

innblue22 supports the Armv8m Security Extension, and by default boots
in the Secure state.

Building Secure/Non-Secure Zephyr applications
==============================================

The process requires the following steps:

1. Build the Secure Zephyr application using ``-DBOARD=innblue22`` and
   ``CONFIG_TRUSTED_EXECUTION_SECURE=y`` in the application project configuration file.
2. Build the Non-Secure Zephyr application using ``-DBOARD=innblue22/nrf9160/ns``.
3. Merge the two binaries together.

When building a Secure/Non-Secure application, the Secure application will
have to set the IDAU (SPU) configuration to allow Non-Secure access to all
CPU resources utilized by the Non-Secure application firmware. SPU
configuration shall take place before jumping to the Non-Secure application.

Building a Secure only application
==================================

Build the Zephyr app in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application`
and :ref:`application_run`), using ``-DBOARD=innblue22``.

Flashing
========

Follow the instructions in the :ref:`nordic_segger` page to install
and configure all the necessary software. Further information can be
found in :ref:`nordic_segger_flashing`. Then build and flash
applications as usual (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

First, run your favorite terminal program to listen for output.

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D <tty_device> -b 115200

Replace :code:`<tty_device>` with the port where the nRF9160 innblue22
can be found. For example, under Linux, :code:`/dev/ttyACM0`.

Then build and flash the application in the usual way.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: innblue22
   :goals: build flash

Debugging
=========

Refer to the :ref:`nordic_segger` page to learn about debugging Nordic boards with a
Segger IC.
