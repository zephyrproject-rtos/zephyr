############################################

Overview
********

The ROC-RK3568-PC is a Quad-Core 64-Bit Mini Computer, which supports 4G large RAM. M.2
and SATA3.0 interfaces enables expansion with large hard drives.
Providing dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, it supports WiFi 6 wireless transmission.
Control Port can be connected with RS485/RS232 devices.

RK3568 quad-core 64-bit Cortex-A55 processor, with brand new ARM v8.2-A architecture,
has frequency up to 2.0GHz. Zephyr OS is ported to run on it.

+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+

Devices
========
System Clock
------------

This board configuration uses a system clock frequency of 24 MHz.
Cortex-A55 Core runs up to 2.0 GHz.

Serial Port
-----------

This board configuration uses a single serial communication channel with the
CPU's UART2.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Use U-Boot to load the zephyr.bin to the memory and kick it:

.. code-block:: console

    tftp 0x40000000 zephyr.bin; dcache flush; icache flush; dcache off; icache off; go 0x40000000

Use this configuration to run basic Zephyr applications and kernel tests,
for example, with the :zephyr:code-sample:`synchronization` sample:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/synchronization
   :host-os: unix
   :board: roc_rk3568_pc
   :goals: run

This will build an image with the synchronization sample app, boot it and
display the following ram console output:

.. code-block:: console

    ***  Booting Zephyr OS build bc695c6df5eb  ***
    thread_a: Hello World from cpu 0 on roc_rk3568_pc!
    thread_b: Hello World from cpu 0 on roc_rk3568_pc!
    thread_a: Hello World from cpu 0 on roc_rk3568_pc!
    thread_b: Hello World from cpu 0 on roc_rk3568_pc!


``roc_rk3568_pc//smp`` support, use this configuration to run Zephyr smp applications and subsys tests,
for example, with the :zephyr:code-sample:`synchronization` sample:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/synchronization
   :host-os: unix
   :board: roc_rk3568_pc//smp
   :goals: run

This will build an image with the shell_module sample app, boot it and
display the following ram console output:

.. code-block:: console

    ***  Booting Zephyr OS build bc695c6df5eb  ***
    I/TC: Secondary CPU 1 initializing
    I/TC: Secondary CPU 1 switching to normal world boot
    I/TC: Secondary CPU 2 initializing
    I/TC: Secondary CPU 2 switching to normal world boot
    I/TC: Secondary CPU 3 initializing
    I/TC: Secondary CPU 3 switching to normal world boot
    Secondary CPU core 1 (MPID:0x100) is up
    Secondary CPU core 2 (MPID:0x200) is up
    Secondary CPU core 3 (MPID:0x300) is up

    thread_a: Hello World from cpu 0 on roc_rk3568_pc!
    thread_b: Hello World from cpu 1 on roc_rk3568_pc!
    thread_a: Hello World from cpu 0 on roc_rk3568_pc!
    thread_b: Hello World from cpu 1 on roc_rk3568_pc!
