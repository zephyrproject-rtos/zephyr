Overview
********

The Myra SiP Baseboard features Antmicro's **Myra** SiP, which integrates the **STM32G491REI6** MCU,
128kB FRAM, and FTDI FT231XQ USB to UART converter. The board is equipped with temperature,
humidity, and pressure sensors, designed to help monitor conditions in server rooms.

The sensors are placed on a separate island that is detachable from the main PCB and can be
installed directly in the required place. It provides local storage for data logging and a battery
backup for protection against data loss. The board can be used as a building block for PoC solutions
for monitoring environmental parameters.

Key features include:

- STM32G491REI6 MCU (Cortex-M4, 170 MHz)
- 128 KB Fujitsu FRAM
- FTDI FT231XQ USB to UART converter
- 50 mm x 26.5 mm PCB
- USB-C Connector for data and power
- SHT45 temperature + humidity sensor
- BME280 temperature + humidity + pressure sensor
- QWIIC connectors for peripheral expansion
- RTC with battery backup

System Clock
------------

System clock can be driven by an internal or an external oscillator, as well as by the main PLL
clock. By default, system clock is driven by PLL clock at 170MHz (boost mode selected), which in
turn, is driven by the 8MHz high speed external oscillator (HSE). While the HSE oscillator is
capable of operating at frequencies up to 48 MHz by default, in this configuration, it is
specifically set to 8 MHz.

Serial Port
-----------

The Myra SiP Baseboard has 5 U(S)ARTs. The Zephyr console output is assigned to LPUART1. The default
settings are 115200 8N1.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``myra_sip_baseboard`` board target can be built and flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and :ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
********

This board has a USB-JTAG interface and can be used with OpenOCD.

Connect the Myra SiP Baseboard to your host computer using the USB port, then build and flash
the application. Here is an example for :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world`.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: myra_sip_baseboard
   :goals: build flash

Then run a serial host program to connect with the Myra SiP Baseboard, e.g. using picocom:

.. code-block:: console

   $ picocom /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200

.. warning::
   The board has only one port that is used for both programming and the console. For this reason, it is
   recommended to set ``CONFIG_BOOT_DELAY`` to an arbitrary value. This is especially important when
   running twister tests on the device. You should then also use the ``--flash-before`` and
   ``--device-flash-timeout=120`` options:

   .. code-block:: console

       $ scripts/twister --device-testing --device-serial /dev/ttyUSB0 --device-serial-baud 115200 -p myra_sip_baseboard --flash-before --device-flash-timeout=120 -v

Debugging
*********

You can debug an application in the usual way. Here is an example for the
:zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: myra_sip_baseboard
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
