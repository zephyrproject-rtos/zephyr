Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

Connections and IOs
===================

OSD32MP1-BRK Board schematic is available here:
`OSD32MP1-BRK schematics`_.

OSD32MP1-BRK Board pin mapping is available here:
`OSD32MP1-BRK default pin mapping`_.

Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------

- UART7 TX/RX: PA15/PB3 (default console)
- I2C5 SCL/SDA: PA11/PA12
- SPI4 SCK/MISO/MOSI: PE12/PE13/PE14

System Clock
------------

The Cortex®-M4 Core is configured to run at a 209 MHz clock speed.
This value must match the configured mlhclk_ck frequency.

Serial Port
-----------

The Zephyr console output is assigned by default to the RAM console to be dumped
by the Linux Remoteproc Framework on Cortex®-A7 core. To enable the USART2 console, modify
the board's devicetree and the osd32mp1_brk_defconfig board file (or prj.conf project files)
Default USART settings are 115200 8N1.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

The STM32MP157F doesn't have QSPI flash for Cortex®-M4 and it needs to be
started by the Cortex®-A7 core. The Cortex®-A7 core is responsible for loading the
Cortex®-M4 binary application into the RAM, and getting Cortex®-M4 out of reset.
Cortex®-A7 can perform these steps at bootloader level or after the Linux
system has booted.

Cortex®-M4 can use up to 2 different RAMs. The program pointer starts at
the 0x00000000 (RETRAM) address, and the vector table should be loaded at this address.
The following table provides memory mappings for Cortex®-A7 and Cortex®-M4:

+------------+-----------------------+------------------------+----------------+
| Region     | Cortex®-A7            | Cortex®-M4             | Size           |
+============+=======================+========================+================+
| RETRAM     | 0x38000000-0x3800FFFF | 0x00000000-0x0000FFFF  | 64KB           |
+------------+-----------------------+------------------------+----------------+
| MCUSRAM    | 0x10000000-0x1005FFFF | 0x10000000-0x1005FFFF  | 384KB          |
+------------+-----------------------+------------------------+----------------+
| DDR        | 0xC0000000-0x20000000 |                        | 512MB          |
+------------+-----------------------+------------------------+----------------+

Refer to following instructions to boot Zephyr on the Cortex®-M4 core:

1. Download and install the Octavo OpenSTLinux distribution:
   `OSD32MP1 OpenSTLinux`_.

   (You can find more details about this process here: `OSD32MP1-BRK Getting Started`_)

2. Build the Zephyr application:

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
      :board: osd32mp1_brk
      :goals: build

3. Transfer the built firmware to the board via USB RNDIS:

   .. code-block:: console

      scp build/zephyr/zephyr.elf root@192.168.7.1:/lib/firmware

4. Boot Zephyr on the Cortex®-M4 core:

   .. code-block:: console

      ssh root@192.168.7.1
      echo stop > /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc0/state
      echo -n zephyr.elf > /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc0/firmware
      echo start > /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc0/state
      cat /sys/kernel/debug/remoteproc/remoteproc0/trace0

   The console output should display:

   .. code-block::

      *** Booting Zephyr OS build v4.0.0 ***
      Hello World! osd32mp1_brk/osd32mp15x


Refer to `OSD32MP1-BRK Getting Started`_ and `stm32mp157 boot Cortex-M4 firmware`_ wiki page for more
detailed instructions.

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application using OpenOCD and GDB. The solution proposed below
is based on attaching to preloaded firmware, which is available only for a Linux
environment. The firmware must first be loaded by the Cortex®-A7. The developer
then attaches the debugger to the running Zephyr using OpenOCD.

The principle is to attach to the firmware already loaded by Linux.

- Build the sample:

  .. zephyr-app-commands::
     :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
     :board: osd32mp1_brk
     :goals: build

- Copy the firmware on the target filesystem, load it and start it (`stm32mp157 boot Cortex-M4 firmware`_).
- Attach to the target:

  .. code-block:: console

    west attach
