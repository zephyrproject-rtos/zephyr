Supported Features

Programming and Debugging
*************************

RZ/A3UL-EVKIT uses Initial Program Loader (IPL) to perform initial settings and copy the Zephyr image from flash to DDR SRAM for execution. It only needs to be written to flash once.

There are two options to write IPL:

1. (Recommended) Follow ''4. Tutorial: Your First RZ MPU Project - Blinky'' of `Getting Started with RZ/A Flexible Software Package`_
   to start writing a blinky sample with FSP. The IPL will be written to flash by default in debugging time.

2. Follow the `Initial Program Loader Application Note`_ to write the IPL separately. The minimal steps are described below.

   a. Follow ''6. IPL development environment construction procedure'' to prepare the build environment.

   b. Follow ''7. IPL build environment construction procedure'' to build Initial Program Loader.
      If the build is successful, Initial Program Loader file will be generated in /build/a3ul/release/rza3ul_smarc_qspi_ipl.srec

   c. Follow ''8.1 Create Debug Configuration'' to create a Debug configuration to run Initial Program Loader on the target board.

   d. Follow ''8.2 Connection to SMARC EVK Board'' to setup target board with SW1 Debugger Enable (SW1-1 OFF) and Boot (1.8V) Mode (SW11[1:4]=OFF OFF OFF ON).

   e. Follow ''8.4 Execution procedure of IPL'' to write Initial Program Loader to the target board.

Applications for the ``rza3ul_smarc`` board can be built in the usual way as
documented in :ref:`build_an_application`.

Console
=======
The UART port is accessed by USB Type-mircoB port (CN14).

Debugging
=========

It is possible to load and execute a Zephyr application binary on this board on the Cortex-A55 System Core
from the DDR SDRAM, using ``JLink`` debugger (:ref:`jlink-debug-host-tools`).

Here is an example for building and debugging with the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: rza3ul_smarc
   :goals: build debug

Flashing
========

Zephyr application can be flashed to QSPI/Octal-SPI storage and then loaded by Initial Program Loader.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: rza3ul_smarc
   :goals: build flash
