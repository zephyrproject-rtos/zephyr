RA8T1 Evaluation Kit
####################

Overview
********

The **MCK-RA8T1** is a development kit that enables easy evaluation of motor control using permanent magnet synchronous
motors (brushless DC motors). More detailed information about the features of this toolkit and it's applications can be
found here: `MCK-RA8T1 Website`_

MCK-RA8T1 kit includes the items below:

- RA8T1 CPU board (`MCB-RA8T1`_)
- Inverter board (`MCI-LV-1`_)
- Communication board (`MC-COM`_)
- Permanent magnet synchronous motors
- Accessories (cables, standoffs, etc.)

**MCB-RA8T1** is a CPU board for motor control equipped with RA8T1. Motor control using RA8T1 can be easily realized by
using it in combination with a supported inverter board. The RA8T1 MCU can be evaluated using this board alone.

By using a supported communication board, the CPU board can be electrically isolated from the PC for safe motor control
evaluation and debugging.

The specifications of the CPU board are shown below:

**MCU specifications**

- 480MHz Arm Cortex-M85 based RA8T1 MCU in 224 pins, BGA package
- ROM/RAM size: 2MB/1MB
- MCU input clock: 24MHz (Generate with external crystal oscillator)
- Power supply: DC 5V, select one way automatically from the below:

  - Power is supplied from compatible inverter board
  - Power is supplied from USB connector

**Connector**

- Inverter board connector (2 pair)
- USB connector for J-Link OB
- USB connector for RA8T1
- SCI connector for Renesas Motor Workbench communication
- Through hole for CAN communication
- 20 pin through hole for Arm debugger
- Pmod connectors (Type6A + Type2A/3A)
- Ethrnet connector
- microSD card connector

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``mcb_ra8t1`` board configuration can be
built, flashed, and debugged in the usual way. See
:ref:`build_an_application` and :ref:`application_run` for more details on
building and running.

**Note:** Only support from SDK v0.16.6 in which GCC for Cortex Arm-M85 was available.
To build for EK-RA8M1 user need to get and install GNU Arm Embedded toolchain from https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/sdk-ng/releases/tag/v0.16.6

Flashing
========

Program can be flashed to MCB-RA8T1 via the on-board SEGGER J-Link debugger.
SEGGER J-link's drivers are avaialbe at https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/

To flash the program to board

  1. Connect to J-Link OB via USB port to host PC

  2. Make sure J-Link OB jumper is in default configuration as describe in `MCB-RA8T1 - User's Manual`_

  3. Execute west command

	.. code-block:: console

		west flash -r jlink

Debugging
=========

You can use Segger Ozone (`Segger Ozone Download`_) for a visual debug interface

Once downloaded and installed, open Segger Ozone and configure the debug project
like so:

* Target Device: R7FA8T1AH
* Target Interface: SWD
* Target Interface Speed: 4 MHz
* Host Interface: USB
* Program File: <path/to/your/build/zephyr.elf>

**Note:** It's verified that debug is OK on Segger Ozone v3.30d so please use this or later
version of Segger Ozone
