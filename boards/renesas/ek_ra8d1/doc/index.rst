RA8D1 Evaluation Kit
####################

Overview
********

The EK-RA8D1 is an Evaluation Kit for Renesas RA8D1 MCU Group which are the industryâ€™s first 32-bit
graphics-enabled MCUs based on the Arm Cortex-M85 (CM85) core, delivering breakthrough performance
of over 3000 Coremark points at 480 MHz and superior graphics capabilities that enable high-resolution
displays and Vision AI applications.

The key features of the EK-RA8D1 board are categorized in three groups as follow:

**MCU Native Pin Access**

- 480MHz Arm Cortex-M85 based RA8D1 MCU in 224 pins, BGA package
- Native pin acces througgh 2 x 50-pin, and 2 x 40-pin male headers
- MCU current measurement points for precision current consumption measurement
- Multiple clock sources - RA8D1 MCU oscillator and sub-clock oscillator crystals,
  providing precision 20.000MHz and 32,768 Hz refeence clocks.
  Additional low precision clocks are avaialbe internal to the RA8D1 MCU

**System Control and Ecosystem Access**

- USB Full Speed Host and Device (micro-AB connector)
- Four 5V input sources

  - USB (Debug, Full Speed, High Speed)
  - External power supply (using surface mount clamp test points and power input vias)

- Three Debug modes

  - Debug on-board (SWD)
  - Debug in (ETM, SWD and JTAG)
  - Debug out (SWD)

- User LEDs and buttons

  - Three User LEDs (red, blue, green)
  - Power LED (white) indicating availability of regulated power
  - Debug LED (yellow) indicating the debug connection
  - Two User buttons
  - One Reset button

- Five most popular ecosystems expansions

  - Two Seeed Grove system (I2C/I3C) connectors
  - One SparkFun Qwiic connector
  - Two Digilent Pmod (SPI, UART and I2C/I3C) connectors
  - Arduino (Uno R3) connector
  - MikroElektronika mikroBUS connector

- MCU boot configuration jumper

**Special Feature Access**

- Ethernet (RJ45 RMII interface)
- USB High Speed Host and Device (micro-AB connector)
- 512 Mb (64 MB) External Octo-SPI Flash (present in the MCU Native Pin Access area of the EK-RA8D1 board)
- CAN FD (3-pin header)

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``ek_ra8d1`` board configuration can be
built, flashed, and debugged in the usual way. See
:ref:`build_an_application` and :ref:`application_run` for more details on
building and running.

**Note:** Only support from SDK v0.16.6 in which GCC for Cortex Arm-M85 was available.
To build for EK-RA8M1 user need to get and install GNU Arm Embedded toolchain from https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/sdk-ng/releases/tag/v0.16.6

Flashing
========

Program can be flashed to EK-RA8D1 via the on-board SEGGER J-Link debugger.
SEGGER J-link's drivers are avaialbe at https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/

To flash the program to board

  1. Connect to J-Link OB via USB port to host PC

  2. Make sure J-Link OB jumper is in default configuration as describe in `EK-RA8D1 - User's Manual`_

  3. Execute west command

	.. code-block:: console

		west flash -r jlink

Debugging
=========

You can use Segger Ozone (`Segger Ozone Download`_) for a visual debug interface

Once downloaded and installed, open Segger Ozone and configure the debug project
like so:

* Target Device: R7FA8D1BH
* Target Interface: SWD
* Target Interface Speed: 4 MHz
* Host Interface: USB
* Program File: <path/to/your/build/zephyr.elf>

**Note:** It's verified that debug is OK on Segger Ozone v3.30d so please use this or later
version of Segger Ozone
