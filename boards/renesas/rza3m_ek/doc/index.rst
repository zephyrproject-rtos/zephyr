Overview
********

The EK-RZ/A3M evaluation kit enables users to easily evaluate the features of the RZ/A3M MPU.
This kit includes an EK-RZ/A3M board, 5-inch 720x1280 pixel LCD MIPI graphics expansion board, and
USB cables, allowing the seamless evaluation of high-definition human machine interface (HMI), camera
input through USB, and more features. Equipped with an on-board J-Link debugger, users can
conveniently start debugging without additional debuggers.
Additionally, it also has several expansion connectors such as SDIO, PMOD,and Arduino to connect
sensors, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth® Low Energy (LE), allowing users to add more features without
expanding the board space.

Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

Programming and Debugging
*************************

EK-RZ/A3M uses Initial Program Loader (IPL) to perform initial settings and copy the Zephyr image from flash to DDR SRAM for execution.
It only needs to be written to flash at lease once before running Zephyr.

1. For the board setup and connections, follow "3.2 Board Setup" of `Getting Started with RZ/A Flexible Software Package`_.

2. Enable the IPL build with ``-DCONFIG_BUILD_WITH_RZA_IPL=y``.
   The IPL image ``rza3m_ek_nor_ipl.bin`` is generated under zephyrproject/zephyr/build/rza_ipl/a3m/release

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: rza3m_ek
   :goals: build
   :gen-args: -DCONFIG_BUILD_WITH_RZA_IPL=y

.. note::
   Currently, the IPL source code can built on Linux environment only.
   For Windows, please follow `Initial Program Loader Application Note`_

3. Flash it onto the board at address 0x20000000 by Jlink command `Segger JLink Renesas R9A07G066`_

.. code-block:: console

   $ JLinkExe
   J-Link> connect
   Device> R9A07G066M04
   TIF> s
   Speed> [Enter]
   J-Link> h
   J-Link> loadfile <ipl_bin_path> 0x20000000

Where ``<ipl_bin_path>`` is the path to the ``rza3m_ek_nor_ipl.bin`` in the output directory.

Applications for the ``rza3m_ek`` board can be built in the usual way as
documented in :ref:`build_an_application`.

Console
=======
The UART port is accessed by USB Debug connector (J10).

Debugging
=========

It is possible to load and execute a Zephyr application binary on this board on the Cortex-A55 System Core
from the DDR SDRAM, using ``JLink`` debugger (:ref:`jlink-debug-host-tools`).

Here is an example for building and debugging with the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: rza3m_ek
   :goals: build debug

Flashing
========

Zephyr application can be flashed to Quad-SPI storage and then loaded by Initial Program Loader.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: rza3m_ek
   :goals: build flash
