RA6M5 Evaluation Kit
####################

Overview
********

The Renesas RA6M5 group uses the high-performance Arm速 Cortex速-M33 core with
TrustZone速. The RA6M5 is suitable for IoT applications requiring Ethernet, future
proof security, large embedded RAM, and low active power consumption down
to 107uA/MHz running the CoreMark速 algorithm from Flash.

The key features of the EK-RA6M5 board are categorized in three groups as follow:

**MCU Native Pin Access**

- 200MHz Arm Cortex-M33 based RA6M5 MCU in 176 pins, LQFP package
- Native pin access through 4 x 40-pin male headers
- MCU current measurement points for precision current consumption measurement
- Multiple clock sources - RA6M5 MCU oscillator and sub-clock oscillator crystals,
  providing precision 24.000 MHz and 32,768 Hz reference clock.
  Additional low precision clocks are avaialbe internal to the RA6M5 MCU

**System Control and Ecosystem Access**

- USB Full Speed Host and Device (micro-AB connector)
- Four 5V input sources

  - USB (Debug, Full Speed, High Speed)
  - External power supply (using surface mount clamp test points and power input vias)

- Three Debug modes

  - Debug on-board (SWD)
  - Debug in (ETM, SWD and JTAG)
  - Debug out (SWD)

- User LEDs and buttons

  - Three User LEDs (red, blue, green)
  - Power LED (white) indicating availability of regulated power
  - Debug LED (yellow) indicating the debug connection
  - Two User buttons
  - One Reset button

- Five most popular ecosystems expansions

  - Two Seeed Grove system (I2C/Analog) connectors
  - One SparkFun Qwiic connector
  - Two Digilent Pmod (SPI and UART) connectors
  - Arduino (Uno R3) connector
  - MikroElektronika mikroBUS connector

- MCU boot configuration jumper

**Special Feature Access**

- Ethernet (RJ45 RMII interface)
- USB High Speed Host and Device (micro-AB connector)
- 32 Mb (256 Mb) External Quad-SPI Flash
- 64 Mb (512 Mb) External Octo-SPI Flash
- CAN (3-pin header)

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``ek_ra6m5`` board target configuration can be
built, flashed, and debugged in the usual way. See
:ref:`build_an_application` and :ref:`application_run` for more details on
building and running.

Flashing
========

Program can be flashed to EK-RA6M5 via the on-board SEGGER J-Link debugger.
SEGGER J-link's drivers are avaialbe at https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/

To flash the program to board

  1. Connect to J-Link OB via USB port to host PC

  2. Make sure J-Link OB jumper is in default configuration as describe in `EK-RA6M5 - User's Manual`_

  3. Execute west command

	.. code-block:: console

		west flash -r jlink

Debugging
=========

You can use Segger Ozone (`Segger Ozone Download`_) for a visual debug interface

Once downloaded and installed, open Segger Ozone and configure the debug project
like so:

* Target Device: R7FA6M5BH
* Target Interface: SWD
* Target Interface Speed: 4 MHz
* Host Interface: USB
* Program File: <path/to/your/build/zephyr.elf>

**Note:** It's verified that we can debug OK on Segger Ozone v3.30d so please use this or later
version of Segger Ozone
