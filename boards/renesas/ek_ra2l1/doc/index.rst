Programming and debugging
*************************

Building & Flashing
===================

You can build and flash an application with onboard J-Link debug adapter.
:ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Here is an example for building and flashing the :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: ek_ra2l1
   :goals: build flash


Debugging
=========

Debugging also can be done with onboard J-Link debug adapter.
The following command is debugging the :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application.
Also, see the instructions specific to the debug server that you use.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: ek_ra2l1
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug

Or you can use Segger Ozone (`Segger Ozone Download`_) for a visual debug interface

Once downloaded and installed, open Segger Ozone and configure the debug project
like so:

* Target Device: R7FA2L1AB
* Target Interface: SWD
* Target Interface Speed: 4 MHz
* Host Interface: USB
* Program File: <path/to/your/build/zephyr.elf>
