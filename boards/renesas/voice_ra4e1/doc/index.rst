RA4E1 Voice User Reference Kit
##############################

Overview
********

VOICE-RA4E1 is an edge voice recognition evaluation kit designed to be used by Ecosystem Partners,
Application Engineers, Field Application Engineers, and for Business Development opportunities. The
primary purpose is to evaluate the functionality of projects developed by Ecosystem Partners, and to
facilitate the development of additional partner projects. The kit design to use the RA4E1 MCU with QFN
48pin package as the core logic device, with QSPI flash, OPAMP and power devices chosen from the
Renesas product portfolio.

The MCU in this series incorporates a high-performance Arm Cortex®-M33 core running up to
100 MHz with the following features:

**MCU Native Pin Access**

- R7FA4E10D2CNE MCU (referred to as RA MCU)
- 100 MHz, Arm® Cortex®-M33 core
- 512 KB Code Flash, 8 KB Data Flash, 128 KB SRAM
- 48 pins, LQFP package
- MCU current measurement point for precision current consumption measurement
- Multiple clock sources - Low-precision (~1%) clocks are available internal to the RA MCU.

**Kit Peripheral Features**

Following is a list of the specific features that have been implemented:

- QSPI: One QSPI flash memory device, Dialog AT25SF641B-MHB-T, 64M-bit (8MB).
- PMOD: 1 Digilent PMOD connectors, supporting UART, SPI and I2C configurations.
- Microphones: 1 I2S MEMS digital microphones and 2 MEMS analog microphones, distance between
  each pair of microphones is 50mm which is suitable for beamforming applications.
- Audio out: One stereo audio headphone jack supporting mono output on both channels.
- LEDs: Five LEDs, D2 (Red), D3 (Green) and D4 (Blue) configurable by user, D5 (Blue) as a 3.3V power
  indicator, D8(Green) as a JLOB (J-LINK on board) indicator.
- Buttons: One RESET button (S2), and one USER button (S1).
- Debug: J-Link On-Board debug interface, supporting JTAG or SWD debug port.
- USB: Micro USB-B (J6) for power input and J-Link On-Board function, USB-C (J1) for power input and
  RA4E1 USB Full Speed port as a USB device.
- Form Factor: 7.5 x 6 cm

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``voice_ra4e1`` board can be
built, flashed, and debugged in the usual way. See
:ref:`build_an_application` and :ref:`application_run` for more details on
building and running.

Flashing
========

Program can be flashed to VOICE-RA4E1 via the on-board SEGGER J-Link debugger.
SEGGER J-link's drivers are avaialbe at https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/

To flash the program to board

1. Connect to J-Link OB via USB port to host PC

2. Make sure J-Link OB jumper is in default configuration as describe in `VOICE-RA4E1 - Engineering Manual`_

3. Execute west command

	.. code-block:: console

		west flash -r jlink

Debugging
=========

You can use Segger Ozone (`Segger Ozone Download`_) for a visual debug interface

Once downloaded and installed, open Segger Ozone and configure the debug project
like so:

* Target Device: R7FA4E10D
* Target Interface: SWD
* Target Interface Speed: 4 MHz
* Host Interface: USB
* Program File: <path/to/your/build/zephyr.elf>

**Note:** It's verified that we can debug OK on Segger Ozone v3.30d so please use this or later
version of Segger Ozone
