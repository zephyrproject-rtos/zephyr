- Internal high-speed oscillator and low-speed on-chip oscillators
- Three low power consumption modes

**System Control and Debugging**

- USB Full-Speed Device (mini-B connector) for communication and power

- Power source options:

  - USB-powered (debug port)
  - External power supply via standard input

- Debugging support:

  - Via Jlink debugger with RX adapter boards.

- User LEDs and buttons:

  - Four User LEDs (red x2, yellow, green)
  - Power LED (green) indicating availability of regulated power
  - One Reset button, three User buttons

- Ecosystems expansions:

  - Two Digilent Pmod (LCD and Spare) connectors
  - 2Kbit I2C EEPROM

Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

Programming and Debugging
*************************

.. zephyr:board-supported-runners::

Applications for the ``rsk_rx130@512kb`` board target configuration can be
built, flashed, and debugged as below.

Currently, the Zephyr SDK hasn't added support for RX builds yet, so the GCC for RX toolchain is required and build system need to be set to use "cross-compile".

  - Download and install GCC for RX v8.3.0.202405 toolchain:

    https://llvm-gcc-renesas.com/rx-download-toolchains/

  - Set env variable:

   .. code-block:: console

      export ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT=cross-compile
      export CROSS_COMPILE=<Path to your toolchain>/bin/rx-elf-

  - Build the Blinky Sample for RSK-RX130-512KB:

   .. code-block:: console

      cd ~/zephyrproject/zephyr
      west build -p always -b rsk_rx130@512kb samples/basic/blinky

Flashing
========

Program can be flashed to RSKRX130-512KB via Jlink with RX adapter boards.

To flash the program to board

  1. Connect from board's debug connector port to host PC using Jlink debugger.

  2. Execute west command

   .. code-block:: console

      west flash

Debugging
=========

You can use `Renesas Debug extension`_ on Visual Studio code for a visual debug interface.
The configuration for launch.json is as below.

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "renesas-hardware",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Renesas GDB Hardware Debugging",
            "target": {
                "deviceFamily": "RX",
                "device": "R5F51308",
                "debuggerType": "SEGGERJLINKRX",
            }
        }
    ]
  }
