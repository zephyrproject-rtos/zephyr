Programming and Debugging
*************************

.. zephyr:board-supported-runners::

Applications for the ``cpkcor_ra8d1b`` board can be
built, flashed, and debugged in the usual way. See
:ref:`build_an_application` and :ref:`application_run` for more details on
building and running.

**Note:** Only support from SDK v0.16.6 in which GCC for Cortex Arm-M85 was available.
To build for CPKCOR-RA8D1B user need to get and install GNU Arm Embedded toolchain from https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/sdk-ng/releases/tag/v0.16.6

Flashing
========

Program can be flashed to CPKCOR-RA8D1B via the on-board SEGGER J-Link debugger.

To flash the program to board

1. Connect to J-LINK OB via USB port to host PC

2. Execute west command

	.. code-block:: console

		west flash

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: cpkcor_ra8d1b
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
