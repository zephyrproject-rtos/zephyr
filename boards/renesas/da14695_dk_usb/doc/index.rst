System Clock
============

The DA14695 Development Kit USB is configured to use the 32 MHz external oscillator
on the board.

Connections and IOs
===================

The DA14695 Development Kit USB has one LED and one push button which can be used
by applications. The UART is connected to on-board serial converter and accessible
via USB1 port on motherboard.

The pin connections are as follows:

* LED (red), = P1.01
* BUTTON, labeled k1 = P0.06
* UART RX, connected to J-Link serial = P0.08
* UART TX, connected to J-Link serial = P0.09

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``da14695_dk_usb`` board configuration can be
built, flashed, and debugged in the usual way. See
:ref:`build_an_application` and :ref:`application_run` for more details on
building and running.

Flashing
========

The DA14695 boots from an external flash connected to QSPI interface. The image
written to flash has to have proper header prepended. The process is simplified
by using dedicated `eZFlashCLI`_ tool that takes care of writing header and can
handle different types of flash chips connected to DA1469x MCU. Follow instructions
on `ezFlashCLI`_ to install the tool. Once installed, flashing can be done in the
usual way.

   :goals: build flash

Debugging
=========

The DA14695 Development Kit USB includes a `J-Link`_ adaptor built-in
which provides both debugging interface and serial port.
Application can be debugged in the usual way once DA14695 Development Kit USB
is connected to PC via USB.
