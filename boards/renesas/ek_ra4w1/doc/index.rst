RA4W1 Evaluation Kit
####################

Overview
********

The Renesas RA4W1 is the first Bluetooth® 5.0 Low Energy fully compliant with 2Mbit High-Throughput
(HT) and Long Range support in a single chip MCU of Renesas RA4  product series for IoT applications
that require a high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 core at a very attractive price point. The RA4W1 MCU
has full function support for Bluetooth 5.0 Low Energy long-range and mesh networking, and provides
excellent reception performance. RA4W1 is geared towards IoT application requiring Security, large
embedded RAM and low power consumption.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``ek_ra4w1`` board target configuration can be
built, flashed, and debugged in the usual way. See
:ref:`build_an_application` and :ref:`application_run` for more details on
building and running.

Flashing
========

Program can be flashed to EK-RA4W1 via the on-board SEGGER J-Link debugger.
SEGGER J-link's drivers are avaialbe at https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/

To flash the program to board

  1. Connect to J-Link OB via USB port to host PC

  2. Make sure J-Link OB jumper is in default configuration as describe in `EK-RA4W1 - User's Manual`_

  3. Execute west command

	.. code-block:: console

		west flash -r jlink

Debugging
=========

You can use Segger Ozone (`Segger Ozone Download`_) for a visual debug interface

Once downloaded and installed, open Segger Ozone and configure the debug project
like so:

* Target Device: R7FA4W1AD
* Target Interface: SWD
* Target Interface Speed: 4 MHz
* Host Interface: USB
* Program File: <path/to/your/build/zephyr.elf>

**Note:** It's verified that we can debug OK on Segger Ozone v3.30d so please use this or later
version of Segger Ozone
