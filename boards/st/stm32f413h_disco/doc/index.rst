Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

Pin Mapping
===========

STM32F413H-DISCO Discovery kit has 8 GPIO controllers. These controllers are responsible for pin muxing,
input/output, pull-up, etc.

For more details please refer to `32F413HDISCOVERY board User Manual`_.

Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------
- UART_6_TX : PG14
- UART_6_RX : PG9
- LD1 : PE3
- LD2 : PC5

System Clock
============

STM32F413H-DISCO System Clock could be driven by internal or external oscillator,
as well as main PLL clock. By default System clock is driven by PLL clock at 100MHz,
that is driven by the internal oscillator.

Serial Port
===========

The STM32F413H-DISCO Discovery kit has up to 10 UARTs. The Zephyr console output is assigned to UART6.
Default settings are 115200 8N1.


Programming and Debugging
*************************

STM32F413H-DISCO Discovery kit includes an ST-LINK/V2 embedded debug tool interface.

Applications for the STM32F413H-DISCO board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

The board is configured to be flashed using west `STM32CubeProgrammer`_ runner,
so its :ref:`installation <stm32cubeprog-flash-host-tools>` is required.

Alternatively, OpenOCD or JLink can also be used to flash the board using
the ``--runner`` (or ``-r``) option:

.. code-block:: console

   $ west flash --runner openocd
   $ west flash --runner jlink

Flashing an application to STM32F413H-DISCO
-------------------------------------------

Connect the STM32F413H-DISCO Discovery kit to your host computer using
the USB port, then run a serial host program to connect with your
board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

Then build and flash an application. Here is an example for the
:zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32f413h_disco
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! stm32f413h_disco/stm32f413xx


Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32f413h_disco
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
