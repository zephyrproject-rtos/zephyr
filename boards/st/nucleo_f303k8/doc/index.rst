Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------

The Nucleo F303K8 board features an Arduino Zero V3 connector. Board is configured as follows:

- UART_2 TX/RX : PA2/PA15 (ST-Link Virtual Port Com)
- I2C1 SCL/SDA : PB7/PB6
- SPI1 CS/SCK/MISO/MOSI : PA_4/PA_5/PA_6/PA_7
- LD2       : PB3

System Clock
------------

The Nucleo F303K8 System Clock can be driven by an internal or
external oscillator, as well as by the main PLL clock. By default the
System Clock is driven by the PLL clock at 72 MHz. The input to the
PLL is an 8 MHz internal clock supply.

Serial Port
-----------

The Nucleo F303K8 board has 2 UARTs. The Zephyr console output is assigned
to UART2.  Default settings are 115200 8N1.


Programming and Debugging
*************************

The Nucleo F303K8 board includes an ST-LINK/V2-1 embedded debug tool interface.

Flashing
========

The board is configured to be flashed using west `STM32CubeProgrammer`_ runner,
so its :ref:`installation <stm32cubeprog-flash-host-tools>` is required.

Alternatively, OpenOCD, JLink, or pyOCD can also be used to flash the board using
the ``--runner`` (or ``-r``) option:

.. code-block:: console

   $ west flash --runner openocd
   $ west flash --runner jlink
   $ west flash --runner pyocd
