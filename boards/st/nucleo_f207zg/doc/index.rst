System Clock
------------

Nucleo F207ZG System Clock could be driven by internal or external oscillator,
as well as main PLL clock. By default System clock is driven by PLL clock at 120MHz,
driven by 8MHz high speed external clock.

Serial Port
-----------

Nucleo F207ZG board has 4 UARTs. The Zephyr console output is assigned to UART3.
Default settings are 115200 8N1.

Network interface
-----------------

Ethernet configured as the default network interface

USB
---
Nucleo F207ZG board has a USB OTG dual-role device (DRD) controller that
supports both device and host functions through its micro USB connector
(USB USER). Only USB device function is supported in Zephyr at the moment.

Backup SRAM
-----------

In order to test backup SRAM you may want to disconnect VBAT from VDD. You can
do it by removing ``SB156`` jumper on the back side of the board.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Nucleo F207ZG board includes an ST-LINK/V2-1 embedded debug tool interface.
This interface is supported by the openocd version included in Zephyr SDK.
