ST Nucleo F091RC
################

Overview
********
The STM32 Nucleo-64 development board with STM32F091RC MCU, supports Arduino and ST morpho connectivity.

The STM32 Nucleo board provides an affordable, and flexible way for users to try out new concepts,
and build prototypes with the STM32 microcontroller, choosing from the various
combinations of performance, power consumption, and features.

The Arduino* Uno V3 connectivity support and the ST morpho headers allow easy functionality
expansion of the STM32 Nucleo open development platform with a wide choice of
specialized shields.

The STM32 Nucleo board integrates the ST-LINK/V2-1 debugger and programmer.

The STM32 Nucleo board comes with the STM32 comprehensive software HAL library together
with various packaged software examples.

Other hardware features are not yet supported in this Zephyr port.

The default configuration can be found in
:zephyr_file:`boards/st/nucleo_f091rc/nucleo_f091rc_defconfig`

Connections and IOs
===================

Each of the GPIO pins can be configured by software as output (push-pull or open-drain), as
input (with or without pull-up or pull-down), or as peripheral alternate function. Most of the
GPIO pins are shared with digital or analog alternate functions. All GPIOs are high current
capable except for analog inputs.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``nucleo_f091rc`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

Nucleo F091RC board includes an ST-LINK/V2-1 embedded debug tool interface.
This interface is supported by the openocd version included in the Zephyr SDK.

Flashing an application to Nucleo F091RC
----------------------------------------

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: nucleo_f091rc
   :goals: build flash

You will see the LED blinking every second.

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nucleo_f091rc
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
