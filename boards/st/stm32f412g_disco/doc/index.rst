:zephyr_file:`boards/st/stm32f412g_disco/stm32f412g_disco_defconfig`


Pin Mapping
===========

STM32F412G-DISCO Discovery kit has 8 GPIO controllers. These controllers are responsible for pin muxing,
input/output, pull-up, etc.

For more details please refer to `32F412GDISCOVERY board User Manual`_.

Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------
- UART_2_TX : PA2
- UART_2_RX : PA3
- LD1 : PE0
- LD2 : PE1
- LD3 : PE2
- LD4 : PE3

System Clock
============

STM32F412G-DISCO System Clock could be driven by internal or external oscillator,
as well as main PLL clock. By default System clock is driven by PLL clock at 100MHz,
driven internal oscillator.

Serial Port
===========

The STM32F412G Discovery kit has up to 4 UARTs. The Zephyr console output is assigned to UART2.
Default settings are 115200 8N1.


Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``stm32f412g_disco`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

STM32F412G-DISCO Discovery kit includes an ST-LINK/V2 embedded debug tool interface.
This interface is supported by the openocd version included in Zephyr SDK.

Flashing an application to STM32F412G-DISCO
-------------------------------------------

Connect the STM32F412G-DISCO Discovery kit to your host computer using
the USB port, then run a serial host program to connect with your
board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

Then build and flash an application. Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32f412g_disco
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! arm


Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32f412g_disco
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
