Other hardware features are not yet supported on this Zephyr port.

The default configuration can be found in the defconfig and dts files:

- Common:

  - :zephyr_file:`boards/st/stm32l562e_dk/stm32l562e_dk_common.dtsi`

- Secure target:

  - :zephyr_file:`boards/st/stm32l562e_dk/stm32l562e_dk_defconfig`
  - :zephyr_file:`boards/st/stm32l562e_dk/stm32l562e_dk.dts`

- Non-Secure target:

  - :zephyr_file:`boards/st/stm32l562e_dk/stm32l562e_dk_stm32l562xx_ns_defconfig`
  - :zephyr_file:`boards/st/stm32l562e_dk/stm32l562e_dk_stm32l562xx_ns.dts`

Zephyr board options
====================

The STM32L562e is an SoC with Cortex-M33 architecture. Zephyr provides support
for building for both Secure and Non-Secure firmware.

The BOARD options are summarized below:

+------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| BOARD                        | Description                               |
+==============================+===========================================+
| stm32l562e_dk                | For building Trust Zone Disabled firmware |
+------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| stm32l562e_dk/stm32l562xx/ns | For building Non-Secure firmware          |
+------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+

Here are the instructions to build Zephyr with a non-secure configuration,
using `tfm_ipc_` sample:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ west build -b stm32l562e_dk/stm32l562xx/ns samples/tfm_integration/tfm_ipc/

Once done, before flashing, you need to first run a generated script that
will set platform option bytes config and erase platform (among others,
option bit TZEN will be set).

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ ./build/tfm/api_ns/regression.sh
      $ west flash

Please note that, after having run a TFM sample on the board, you will need to
run `./build/tfm/api_ns/regression.sh` once more to clean up the board from secure
options and get back the platform back to a "normal" state and be able to run
usual, non-TFM, binaries.
Also note that, even then, TZEN will remain set, and you will need to use
STM32CubeProgrammer_ to disable it fully, if required.

Connections and IOs
===================

STM32L562E-DK Discovery Board has 8 GPIO controllers. These controllers are responsible for pin muxing,
input/output, pull-up, etc.

For more details please refer to `STM32L562E-DK Discovery board User Manual`_.

STM32L562E-DK Discovery board has 6 U(S)ARTs. The Zephyr console output is
assigned to USART1. Default settings are 115200 8N1.


Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``stm32l562e_dk`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

STM32L562E-DK Discovery board includes an ST-LINK/V3E embedded debug tool
interface. Support can be enabled on pyocd by adding "pack" support with the
following pyocd command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pyocd pack --update
   $ pyocd pack --install stm32l562qe

Alternatively, this interface is supported by the openocd version
included in the Zephyr SDK since v0.13.1.

Flashing an application to STM32L562E-DK Discovery
--------------------------------------------------

Connect the STM32L562E-DK Discovery to your host computer using the USB port.
Then build and flash an application. Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

Run a serial host program to connect with your Nucleo board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

Then build and flash the application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32l562e_dk
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! stm32l562e_dk

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32l562e_dk
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
