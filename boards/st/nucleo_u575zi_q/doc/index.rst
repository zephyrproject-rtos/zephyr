Nucleo U575ZI Q System Clock could be driven by internal or external oscillator,
as well as main PLL clock. By default System clock is driven by PLL clock at
160MHz, driven by 4MHz medium speed internal oscillator.

Serial Port
-----------

Nucleo U575ZI Q board has 6 U(S)ARTs. The Zephyr console output is assigned to
USART1. Default settings are 115200 8N1.


Backup SRAM
-----------

In order to test backup SRAM you may want to disconnect VBAT from VDD. You can
do it by removing ``SB50`` jumper on the back side of the board.


Programming and Debugging
*************************

Nucleo U575ZI-Q board includes an ST-LINK/V3 embedded debug tool interface.
This probe allows to flash the board using various tools.

Flashing
========

Board is configured to be flashed using west STM32CubeProgrammer runner.
Installation of `STM32CubeProgrammer`_ is then required to flash the board.

Alternatively, openocd (provided in Zephyr SDK), JLink and pyocd can also be
used to flash and debug the board if west is told to use it as runner,
which can be done by passing either ``-r openocd``, ``-r jlink`` or ``-r pyocd``.

For pyocd additional target information needs to be installed.
This can be done by executing the following commands.

.. code-block:: console

   $ pyocd pack --update
   $ pyocd pack --install stm32u5


Flashing an application to Nucleo U575ZI Q
------------------------------------------

Connect the Nucleo U575ZI Q to your host computer using the USB port.
Then build and flash an application. Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

Run a serial host program to connect with your Nucleo board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

Then build and flash the application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nucleo_u575zi_q
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! arm

Debugging
=========

Default flasher for this board is openocd. It could be used in the usual way.
Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: nucleo_u575zi_q
   :goals: debug
