Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

Connections and IOs
===================

STM32H573I-DK Discovery Board has 9 GPIO controllers. These controllers are responsible for pin muxing,
input/output, pull-up, etc.

For more details please refer to `STM32H573I-DK Discovery board User Manual`_.

System Clock
------------

STM32H573I-DK System Clock could be driven by internal or external oscillator,
as well as main PLL clock. By default System clock is driven by PLL clock at
240MHz, driven by 25MHz external oscillator (HSE).

Serial Port

assigned to USART1. Default settings are 115200 8N1.


Programming and Debugging
*************************

STM32H573I-DK Discovery board includes an ST-LINK/V3E embedded debug tool interface.

Applications for the ``stm32h573i_dk`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

OpenOCD Support
===============

For now, OpenOCD support  for STM32H5 is not available on upstream OpenOCD.
You can check `OpenOCD official Github mirror`_.
In order to use it though, you should clone from the customized
`STMicroelectronics OpenOCD Github`_ and compile it following usual README guidelines.
Once it is done, you can set the OPENOCD and OPENOCD_DEFAULT_PATH variables in
:zephyr_file:`boards/st/stm32h573i_dk/board.cmake` to point the build
to the paths of the OpenOCD binary and its scripts,  before
including the common openocd.board.cmake file:

   .. code-block:: none

      set(OPENOCD "<path_to_openocd_repo>/src/openocd" CACHE FILEPATH "" FORCE)
      set(OPENOCD_DEFAULT_PATH <path_to_opneocd_repo>/tcl)
      include(${ZEPHYR_BASE}/boards/common/openocd.board.cmake)


Flashing
========


The board is configured to be flashed using west `STM32CubeProgrammer`_ runner,
so its :ref:`installation <stm32cubeprog-flash-host-tools>` is required.

Alternatively, OpenOCD or pyOCD can also be used to flash the board using
the ``--runner`` (or ``-r``) option:

.. code-block:: console

   $ west flash --runner openocd
   $ west flash --runner pyocd

For pyOCD, additional target information needs to be installed
by executing the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pyocd pack --update
   $ pyocd pack --install stm32h5

Flashing an application to STM32H573I-DK Discovery
--------------------------------------------------

Connect the STM32H573I-DK Discovery to your host computer using the USB port.
Then build and flash an application. Here is an example for the
:zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

Run a serial host program to connect with your Nucleo board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

Then build and flash the application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32h573i_dk
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! stm32h573i_dk

Debugging
=========

Waiting for OpenOCD support, debugging could be performed with pyOCD which
requires to enable "pack" support with the following pyOCD command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pyocd pack --update
   $ pyocd pack --install stm32h5

Once installed, you can debug an application in the usual way. Here is an
example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32h573i_dk
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
