Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``stm32h573i_dk`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

STM32H573I-DK Discovery board includes an ST-LINK/V3E embedded debug tool
interface. Support is available on STM32CubeProgrammer V2.13.0.

Alternatively, this interface will be supported by a next openocd version.

Flashing an application to STM32H573I-DK Discovery
--------------------------------------------------

Connect the STM32H573I-DK Discovery to your host computer using the USB port.
Then build and flash an application. Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

Run a serial host program to connect with your Nucleo board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

Then build and flash the application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32h573i_dk
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! stm32h573i_dk

Debugging
=========

Waiting for openocd support, debugging could be performed with pyocd which
requires to enable "pack" support with the following pyocd command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pyocd pack --update
   $ pyocd pack --install stm32h5

Once installed, you can debug an application in the usual way. Here is an
example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32h573i_dk
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
