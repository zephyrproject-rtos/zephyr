ST STM32G081B Evaluation
########################

Overview
********
The STM32G081B-EVAL Evaluation board is a high-end development platform, for
Arm Cortex-M0+ core-based STM32G081RBT6 microcontroller, with USB Type-C and
power delivery controller interfaces (UCPD), compliant with USB type-C r1.2
and USB PD specification r3.0, two I2Cs, two SPIs, five USARTs, one LP UART,
one 12-bit ADC, two 12-bit DACs, two GP comparators, two LP timers, internal
32 KB SRAM and 128 KB Flash, CEC, SWD debugging support. The full range of
hardware features on the STM32G081B-EVAL Evaluation board includes a mother
board, a legacy peripheral daughterboard and a USB-C and Power Delivery
daughterboard, which help to evaluate all peripherals (USB Type-C connector
with USB PD, motor control connector, RS232, RS485, Audio DAC, microphone ADC,
TFT LCD, IrDA, IR LED, IR receiver, LDR, MicroSD card, CEC on two HDMI
connectors, smart card slot, RF E2PROM & Temperature sensorâ€¦), and to develop
applications.

The board integrates an ST-LINK/V2-1 as an embedded in-circuit debugger and
programmer for the STM32 MCU. The daughterboard and extension connectors
provide an easy way to connect a daughterboard or wrapping board for the
user's specific applications.

The USB-C and Power Delivery daughterboard
features two independent USB-C ports controlled by an STM32G0. USB-C port 1
is dual role power (DRP) and can provide up-to 45 W. USB-C Port 2 is sink
only. Both support USB PD protocol and alternate mode functionality.

Application firmware examples are provided to evaluate the USB-C technology
through various use cases.
