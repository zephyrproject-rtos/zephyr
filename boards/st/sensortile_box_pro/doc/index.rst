#####################

Overview
********

The STEVAL-MKBOXPRO (SensorTile.box PRO) features an ARM Cortex-M33 based STM32U585AI MCU
and is a ready-to-use box kit for wireless IoT and wearable sensor platforms to help using
and developing apps based on remote motion and environmental sensor data.

The SensorTile.box PRO board fits into a small plastic box with a long-life rechargeable
battery, and communicates with a standard smartphone through its Bluetooth interface,
providing data coming from the sensors.

  - **rst** button, used to reset the board (not available on case)
  - **power** switch, used to Power on/off the board

System Clock
============

SensorTile.box PRO System Clock could be driven by internal or external
oscillator, as well as main PLL clock. By default, the System clock is
driven by the PLL clock at 80MHz, driven by the 16MHz external oscillator.
The system clock can be boosted to 120MHz.
The internal AHB/APB1/APB2 AMBA buses are all clocked at 80MHz.

Serial Port
===========

The SensorTile.box PRO has 4 U(S)ARTs. The UART4 is connected to JTAG/SWD connector
and may be used as console.

USB interface
=============

SensorTile.box PRO can be connected as a USB device to a PC host through its USB-C connector.
The final application may use it to declare SensorTile.box PRO device as belonging to a
certain standard or vendor class, e.g. a CDC, a mass storage or a composite device with both
functions.

Console
=======

There are two possible options for Zephyr console output:

- through USB as USB CDC/ACM class. This is the default case present in the board dts file
  and is enabled by :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOARD_SERIAL_BACKEND_CDC_ACM`.

.. code-block:: dts
   :caption: boards/st/sensortile_box_pro/sensortile_box_pro.dts

   / {
       chosen {
          zephyr,console = &cdc_acm_uart0;
        };
     };

     &zephyr_udc0 {
        cdc_acm_uart0: cdc_acm_uart0 {
                compatible = "zephyr,cdc-acm-uart";
        };
     };


- through UART4 which is available on SWD connector (JP2). In this case a JTAG adapter
  can be used to connect SensorTile.box PRO and have both SWD and console lines available.

  To enable console and shell over UART:

  - in your prj.conf, override the board's default configuration by setting :code:`CONFIG_BOARD_SERIAL_BACKEND_CDC_ACM=n`

  - add an overlay file named ``<board>.overlay``:

.. code-block:: dts

   / {
       chosen {
          zephyr,console = &uart4;
          zephyr,shell-uart = &uart4;
        };
     };


Console default settings are 115200 8N1.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

There are two alternative methods of flashing ST Sensortile.box Pro board:

1. Using DFU software tools

   This method requires to enter STM32U585 ROM bootloader DFU mode
   by powering up (or reset) the board while keeping the BOOT0 button pressed.
   No additional hardware is required except a USB-C cable. This method is fully
   supported by :ref:`flash-debug-host-tools`.
   You can read more about how to enable and use the ROM bootloader by checking
   the application note `AN2606`_ (STM32U585xx section).

2. Using SWD hardware tools

   This method requires to connect additional hardware, like a ST-LINK/V3
   embedded debug tool, to the board SWD connector.

DFU flashing
============

Install dfu-util
----------------

It is recommended to use at least v0.9 of dfu-util. The package available in
Debian and Ubuntu can be quite old, so you might have to build dfu-util from source.
Information about how to get the source code and how to build it can be found
at the `DFU-UTIL website`_

Flash an Application to SensorTile.box PRO
------------------------------------------

While pressing the BOOT0 button, connect the USB-C cable to the USB OTG SensorTile.box PRO
port and to your computer. The board should be forced to enter DFU mode.

Check that the board is indeed in DFU mode:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo dfu-util -l
   dfu-util 0.9

   Please report bugs to http://sourceforge.net/p/dfu-util/tickets/

   Found DFU: [0483:df11] ver=2200, devnum=74, cfg=1, intf=0, path="2-2", alt=2, name="@OTP Memory /0x1FFF7000/01*0001Ke", serial="204A325D574D"
   Found DFU: [0483:df11] ver=2200, devnum=74, cfg=1, intf=0, path="2-2", alt=1, name="@Option Bytes  /0x1FF00000/01*040 e/0x1FF01000/01*040 e", serial="204A325D574D"

You should see following confirmation on your Linux host:

.. code-block:: console

   $ dmesg
   usb 2-2: new full-speed USB device number 74 using xhci_hcd
   usb 2-2: New USB device found, idVendor=0483, idProduct=df11
   usb 2-2: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
   usb 2-2: Product: STM32  BOOTLOADER
   usb 2-2: Manufacturer: STMicroelectronics
   usb 2-2: SerialNumber: 204A325D574D

You can build and flash the provided sample application
(:ref:`sensortile_box_pro_sample_sensors`) that reads sensors data and outputs
values on the console.
