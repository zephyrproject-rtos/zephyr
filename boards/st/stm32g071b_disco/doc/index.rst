#######################

Overview
********
The STM32G071B-DISCO Discovery board is a demonstration and development platform
for the STMicroelectronics Arm® Cortex® -M0+ core-based STM32G071RB USB Type-C™
and Power Delivery microcontroller. The STM32G071B-DISCO Discovery board is
presented with all necessary interfaces for easy connection and
interoperability with other USB Type-C™ devices. The STM32G071B-DISCO Discovery
board is intended for discovery and display of USB Type-C™ port characteristics
such as data role, power role, VBUS and IBUS monitoring. It offers an advanced
user mode when associated with the STM32CubeMonUCPD software GUI and can be used
as a USB Type-C™ and Power Delivery analyzer.

Supported Features
==================

The Zephyr stm32g071b_disco board configuration supports the following hardware features:

+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+
| Interface | Controller | Driver/Component                    |
+===========+============+=====================================+
| NVIC      | on-chip    | nested vector interrupt controller  |
+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+
| UART      | on-chip    | serial port-polling;                |
|           |            | serial port-interrupt               |
+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+
| I2C       | on-chip    | i2c                                 |
+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+
| UCPD      | on-chip    | ucpd                                |
+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+
| GPIO      | on-chip    | gpio                                |
+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+
| WATCHDOG  | on-chip    | independent watchdog                |
+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+

Other hardware features are not yet supported in this Zephyr port.

The default configuration can be found in the defconfig file:
:zephyr_file:`boards/st/stm32g071b_disco/stm32g071b_disco_defconfig`

Connections and IOs
===================

Each of the GPIO pins can be configured by software as output (push-pull or open-drain), as
input (with or without pull-up or pull-down), or as peripheral alternate function. Most of the
GPIO pins are shared with digital or analog alternate functions. All GPIOs are high current
capable except for analog inputs.

Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------

- UART_3 TX/RX       : PC10/PC11 (ST-Link Virtual Port Com)
- UCPD1              : PA8/PB15
- BUTTON (JOY_SEL)   : PC0
- BUTTON (JOY_LEFT)  : PC1
- BUTTON (JOY_DOWN)  : PC2
- BUTTON (JOY_RIGHT) : PC3
- BUTTON (JOY_UP)    : PC4
- LED (TO_REC)       : PD9
- LED (TO_PLUG)      : PD8
- LED (SINK_SPY)     : PD5
- LED (SOURCE)       : PC12
- ENCC1              : PB10 (Enable CC1)
- ENCC2              : PB11 (Enable CC2)
- RDCC1              : PB12 (Enable Door Sense on CC1)

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``stm32g071b_disco`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

The STM32G071B Discovery board includes an ST-LINK/V2-1 embedded debug tool interface.

.. code-block:: console

   $ west flash

Flashing an application to the STM32G071B_DISCO
-----------------------------------------------

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: stm32g071b_disco
   :goals: build flash

You will see the LED blinking every second.

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32g071b_disco
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
