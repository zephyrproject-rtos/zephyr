Pin Mapping
===========

STM32F3DISCOVERY Discovery kit has 6 GPIO controllers. These controllers are
responsible for pin muxing, input/output, pull-up, etc.

For more details please refer to `STM32F3DISCOVERY board User Manual`_.

System Clock
============

STM32F3DISCOVERY System Clock could be driven by internal or external
oscillator, as well as main PLL clock. By default System clock is driven
by PLL clock at 72 MHz, driven by 8 MHz MCO from the ST Link.

Serial Port
===========

STM32F3DISCOVERY Discovery kit has up to 5 UARTs. The Zephyr console output
is assigned to UART1. Default settings are 115200 8N1.

I2C
===

STM32F3DISCOVERY has up to 2 I2Cs. I2C1 is connected to the LSM303DLHC and is
an ultra-compact low-power system-in-package featuring a 3D digital linear
acceleration sensor and a 3D digital magnetic sensor.

USB
===
STM32F3DISCOVERY has a USB 2.0 full-speed device interface available through
its mini USB connector (USB USER).

CAN
===
The STM32F3DISCOVERY does not have an onboard CAN transceiver. In
order to use the CAN bus on the this board, an external CAN bus
transceiver must be connected to ``PD0`` (``CAN1_RX``) and ``PD1``
(``CAN1_TX``).

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Flashing
========

STM32F3DISCOVERY Discovery kit includes a ST-LINK/V2 or ST-LINK/V2-B embedded
debug tool interface.

Applications for the ``stm32f3_disco`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing an application to STM32F3DISCOVERY
-------------------------------------------

First, connect the STM32F3DISCOVERY Discovery kit to your host computer using
the USB port to prepare it for flashing. Then build and flash your application.

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32f3_disco
   :goals: build flash


In case you are using a recent PCB revision (E or newer), you have to use an
adapted board definition:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32f3_disco@E
   :goals: build flash

Run a serial host program to connect with your board. For PCB version A or B a
TTL(3.3V) serial adapter is required. For PCB version C and newer a Virtual Com
Port (VCP) is available on the  USB ST-LINK port.

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/<tty device>

Replace <tty_device> with the port where the STM32F3DISCOVERY board can be
found. For example, under Linux, /dev/ttyUSB0.

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! arm


Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32f3_disco
   :goals: debug

Again you have to use the adapted command for newer PCB revisions (E and newer):

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32f3_disco@E
   :goals: debug
