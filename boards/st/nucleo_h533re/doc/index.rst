Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``nucleo_h533re`` board can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

Nucleo H533RE board includes an ST-LINK/V3EC embedded debug tool interface.
This probe allows to flash the board using various tools.

Board is configured to be flashed using west STM32CubeProgrammer runner.
Installation of `STM32CubeProgrammer`_ is then required to flash the board.

Alternatively, pyocd or jlink via an external probe can also be used to flash
and debug the board if west is told to use it as runner, which can be done by
passing either or ``-r pyocd``, or ``-r jlink``.

For pyocd additional target information needs to be installed.
This can be done by executing the following commands.

.. code-block:: console

   $ pyocd pack --update
   $ pyocd pack --install stm32h5


Flashing an application to Nucleo H533RE
------------------------------------------

Connect the Nucleo H533RE to your host computer using the USB port.
Then build and flash an application. Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

Run a serial host program to connect with your Nucleo board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

Then build and flash the application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nucleo_h533re
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! nucleo_h533re

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way. Here is an example for the
:zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: nucleo_h533re
   :goals: debug
