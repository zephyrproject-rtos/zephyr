ST Nucleo H723ZG
################

Overview
********

The STM32 Nucleo-144 board provides an affordable and flexible way for users
to try out new concepts and build prototypes by choosing from the various combinations
of performance and power consumption features, provided by the STM32 microcontroller.
For the compatible boards, the internal or external SMPS significantly reduces power
consumption in Run mode.

The ST Zio connector, which extends the ARDUINOÂ® Uno V3 connectivity, and
the ST morpho headers provide an easy means of expanding the functionality of the Nucleo
open development platform with a wide choice of specialized shields.
The STM32 Nucleo-144 board does not require any separate probe as it integrates
the ST-LINK V3 debugger/programmer.

The STM32 Nucleo-144 board comes with the STM32 comprehensive free software
libraries and examples available with the STM32Cube MCU Package.

Other hardware features are not yet supported on this Zephyr port.

The default configuration can be found in the defconfig files:
:zephyr_file:`boards/st/nucleo_h723zg/nucleo_h723zg_defconfig`

For more details please refer to `STM32 Nucleo-144 board User Manual`_.

Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------

The Nucleo H723ZG board features a ST Zio connector (extended Arduino Uno V3)
and a ST morpho connector. Board is configured as follows:

- UART_3 TX/RX : PD8/PD9 (ST-Link Virtual Port Com)
- USER_PB : PC13
- LD1 : PB0
- LD2 : PB7
- LD3 : PB14
- I2C : PB8, PB9
- SPI1 NSS/SCK/MISO/MOSI : PD14PA5/PA6/PB5 (Arduino SPI)

System Clock
------------

Nucleo H723ZG System Clock could be driven by an internal or external
oscillator, as well as the main PLL clock. By default, the System clock is
driven by the PLL clock at 550MHz, driven by an 8MHz high-speed external clock.

Serial Port
-----------

Nucleo H723ZG board has 4 UARTs and 4 USARTs. The Zephyr console output is
assigned to UART3. Default settings are 115200 8N1.

Backup SRAM
-----------

In order to test backup SRAM you may want to disconnect VBAT from VDD. You can
do it by removing ``SB52`` jumper on the back side of the board.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Currently the ``nucleo_h723zg`` board supports stm32cubeprogrammer (default), OpenOCD and J-Link debuggers.

.. note::

   Official OpenOCD support for this board was added on October '20.
   Make sure your openocd version is older than that.
   Following links may be helpful: `OpenOCD installing Debug Version`_
   and `OpenOCD installing with ST-LINK V3 support`_

.. note::

   Check if your ST-LINK V3 has newest FW version. It can be done with `STM32CubeIDE`_

Flashing
========

Nucleo H723ZG board includes an ST-LINK/V3 embedded debug tool interface.

First, connect the NUCLEO-H723ZG to your host computer using
the USB port to prepare it for flashing. Then build and flash your application.

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

Run a serial host program to connect with your NUCLEO-H723ZG board.

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -b 115200 -D /dev/ttyACM0

or use screen:

.. code-block:: console

   $ screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200

Build and flash the application:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nucleo_h723zg
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   $ Hello World! nucleo_h723zg

Blinky example can also be used:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: nucleo_h723zg
   :goals: build flash

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nucleo_h723zg
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
