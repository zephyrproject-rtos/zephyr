as well as main PLL clock. By default System clock is driven by PLL clock at 96MHz,
driven by 8MHz high speed external clock.

Serial Port
-----------

Nucleo F413ZH board has 10 UARTs. The Zephyr console output is assigned to UART3.
Default settings are 115200 8N1.

USB
===
Nucleo F413ZH board has a USB OTG dual-role device (DRD) controller that
supports both device and host functions through its micro USB connector
(USB USER). Only USB device function is supported in Zephyr at the moment.
