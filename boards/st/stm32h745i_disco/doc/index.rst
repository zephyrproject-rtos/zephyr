Overview
********

The STM32H745I-DISCO Discovery kit is a complete demonstration and development
platform for STMicroelectronics Arm |reg| Cortex |reg|‑M7 and Cortex |reg|‑M4 core-based STM32H745XI microcontroller.

The full range of hardware features available on the board helps users enhance their application
development by an evaluation of almost all peripherals (such as USB OTG FS, Ethernet 10/100Mb/s,
eMMC, USART, SAI audio DAC stereo with audio jack input and output, MEMS digital microphone, SDRAM,
Quad-SPI flash memory, and RGB interface LCD with capacitive multi-touch panel). ARDUINO |reg| Uno V3

Other hardware features are not yet supported on this Zephyr port.

The default configuration per core can be found in the defconfig files:
:zephyr_file:`boards/st/stm32h745i_disco/stm32h745i_disco_stm32h745xx_m7_defconfig` and
:zephyr_file:`boards/st/stm32h745i_disco/stm32h745i_disco_stm32h745xx_m4_defconfig`

For more details please refer to `STM32H745-Disco UM`_.

Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------

- USART_3 TX/RX : PB10/PB11 (ST-Link Virtual Port Com)
- USART_1 TX/RX : PB6/PB7 (Arduino Serial)
- SPI_2 NSS/SCK/MISO/MOSI : PB4/PD3/PI2/PB15 (Arduino SPI)
- I2C_4 SCL/SDA: PD12, PD13 (Arduino I2C)
- USER_PB : PC13
- LD1 : PI13
- LD2 : PJ2
- LD3 : PD3

System Clock
------------

STM32H745I-DISCO System Clock could be driven by an internal or external
oscillator, as well as the main PLL clock. By default, the System clock is
driven by the PLL clock at 480MHz, driven by an 25MHz high-speed external clock.

Serial Port
-----------

STM32H745I-DISCO board has 4 UARTs and 4 USARTs. The Zephyr console output is
assigned to UART3. Default settings are 115200 8N1.

Resources sharing
-----------------

The dual core nature of STM32H745 SoC requires sharing HW resources between the
two cores. This is done in 3 ways:

- **Compilation**: Clock configuration is only accessible to M7 core. M4 core only
  has access to bus clock activation and deactivation.
- **Static pre-compilation assignment**: Peripherals such as a UART are assigned in
  devicetree before compilation. The user must ensure peripherals are not assigned
  to both cores at the same time.
- **Run time protection**: Interrupt-controller and GPIO configurations could be
  accessed by both cores at run time. Accesses are protected by a hardware semaphore
  to avoid potential concurrent access issues.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``stm32h745i_disco`` board should be built per core target,
using either ``stm32h745i_disco/stm32h745xx/m7`` or ``stm32h745i_disco/stm32h745xx/m4`` as the target
(see :ref:`build_an_application` and :ref:`application_run` for more details).

.. note::

   Check if the on-board ST-LINK V3 has the latest firmware version. It can be done with either `STM32CubeIDE`_ or `STM32CubeProgrammer`_

Flashing
========

STM32H745I-DISCO board includes an ST-LINK/V3 embedded debug tool interface.

Flashing operation will depend on the target and the SoC
option bytes configuration.

By default:

  - CPU0 (Cortex-M7) boot address is set to 0x80000000 (OB: BOOT_CM7_ADD0)
  - CPU1 (Cortex-M4) boot address is set to 0x81000000 (OB: BOOT_CM4_ADD0)

Also, the out of the box default board configuration enables CM7 and CM4 boot when
board is powered (Option bytes BCM7 and BCM4 are checked).
In that configuration, Kconfig boot option ``STM32H7_BOOT_CM4_CM7`` should be selected.
Zephyr flash configuration has been set to meet these default settings.

Alternatively, west `STM32CubeProgrammer`_ runner can be used, after installing
it, to flash applications for both cores. The target core is detected automatically.

.. code-block:: console

   $ west flash --runner stm32cubeprogrammer

Flashing an application to STM32H745XI M7 Core
----------------------------------------------
First, connect the STM32H745I-DISCO to your host computer using
the USB port to prepare it for flashing. Then build and flash your application.

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

Run a serial host program to connect with your STM32H745I-DISCO board.

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -b 115200 -D /dev/ttyACM0

or use screen:

.. code-block:: console

   $ screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200

Build and flash the application:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32h745i_disco/stm32h745xx/m7
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   $ Hello World! stm32h745i_disco

.. note::
  Sometimes, flashing does not work properly. It is necessary to erase the flash
  (with STM32CubeProgrammer for example) to make it work again.

Similarly, you can build and flash samples on the M4 target. For this, please
take care of the resource sharing (UART port used for console for instance).

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application on M4 core.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: stm32h745i_disco/stm32h745xx/m7
   :goals: build flash

.. note::

   Flashing both M4 and M7 and pushing RESTART button on the board leads
   to LD1 and LD2 flashing simultaneously.

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32h745i_disco/stm32h745xx/m7
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug

Debugging with west is currently not available on Cortex M4 side.
In order to debug a Zephyr application on Cortex M4 side, you can use
`STM32CubeIDE`_.
