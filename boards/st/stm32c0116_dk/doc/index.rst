.. zephyr:board:: stm32c0116_dk

Overview
********

The STM32C0116-DK Discovery kit helps to discover features of the STM32C0 Series
microcontroller in a UFQFPN20 package. This Discovery kit features one UFQFPN20
to DIL20 module designed with the STM32C011F6 microcontroller and allows the user to develop
and share applications. It includes an on-board ST-LINK/V2-1 to debug and program the embedded
STM32 microcontroller. Important board features include:

More information about the board can be found at the `STM32C0116-DK website`_.

==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

Pin Mapping
===========

STM32C0116-DK Discovery kit has 4 GPIO controllers. These controllers are responsible for pin muxing,
input/output, pull-up, etc.

For more details please refer to `STM32C0116-DK board User Manual`_.

Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------

The STM32C0116 Discovery board is configured as follows:

- UART_2 TX/RX : PA2/PA3
- UART_1 TX/RX : PA9/PA10 (ST-Link Virtual Port Com)
- PWM_1_CH3 : PB6
- ADC1_CH8 : PA8
- LD3 : PB6

Programming and Debugging
*************************

STM32C0116-DK Discovery kit includes an ST-LINK/V2 embedded debug tool interface.

Applications for the ``stm32c0116_dk`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

The board is configured to be flashed using west `STM32CubeProgrammer`_ runner,
so its :ref:`installation <stm32cubeprog-flash-host-tools>` is required.

Alternatively, JLink can also be used to flash the board using
the ``--runner`` (or ``-r``) option:

.. code-block:: console

   $ west flash --runner jlink

Flashing an application to STM32C0116-DK
-------------------------------------------

First, connect the STM32C0116 Discovery kit to your host computer using
the USB port to prepare it for flashing. Then build and flash your application.

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32c0116_dk
   :goals: build flash

Run a serial host program to connect with your board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! arm
