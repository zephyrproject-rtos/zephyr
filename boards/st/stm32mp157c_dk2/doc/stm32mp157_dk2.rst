Connections and IOs
===================

STM32MP157C-DK2 Discovery Board schematic is available here:
`STM32MP157C Discovery board schematics`_.


Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------

- USART_3 TX/RX : PB10/PB12 (UART console)
- UART_7 TX/RX : PE8/PE7 (Arduino Serial)
- I2C5 SCL/SDA : PA11/PA12 (Arduino I2C)
- SPI4 SCK/MISO/MOSI : PE12/PE13/PE14 (Arduino SPI)
- SPI5 SCK/MISO/MOSI : PF7/PF8/PF9

System Clock
------------

The Cortex®-M4 Core is configured to run at a 209 MHz clock speed. This value
must match the configured mlhclk_ck frequency.

Serial Port
-----------

The STM32MP157C-DK2 Discovery board has 8 U(S)ARTs.
The Zephyr console output is assigned by default to the RAM console to be dumped
by the Linux Remoteproc Framework on Cortex®-A7 core. In order to keep the UART7
free for future serial interactions with Arduino shield, the Zephyr UART console
output is USART3 and is disabled by default. UART console can be enable through
board's devicetree and stm32mp157c_dk2_defconfig board file (or prj.conf
project files), and will disable existing RAM console output. Default UART
console settings are 115200 8N1.

Programming and Debugging
*************************
The STM32MP157C doesn't have QSPI flash for the Cortex®-M4  and it needs to be
started by the Cortex®-A7 core. The Cortex®-A7 core is responsible to load the
Cortex®-M4 binary application into the RAM, and get the Cortex®-M4 out of reset.
The Cortex®-A7 can perform these steps at bootloader level or after the Linux
system has booted.

The Cortex®-M4 can use up to 2 different RAMs. The program pointer starts at
address 0x00000000 (RETRAM), the vector table should be loaded at this address
These are the memory mappings for Cortex®-A7 and Cortex®-M4:

+------------+-----------------------+------------------------+----------------+
| Region     | Cortex®-A7            | Cortex®-M4             | Size           |
+============+=======================+========================+================+
| RETRAM     | 0x38000000-0x3800FFFF | 0x00000000-0x0000FFFF  | 64KB           |
+------------+-----------------------+------------------------+----------------+
| MCUSRAM    | 0x10000000-0x1005FFFF | 0x10000000-0x1005FFFF  | 384KB          |
+------------+-----------------------+------------------------+----------------+
| DDR        | 0xC0000000-0xFFFFFFFF |                        | up to 1 GB     |
+------------+-----------------------+------------------------+----------------+


Refer to `stm32mp157c boot Cortex-M4 firmware`_ wiki page for instruction
to load and start the Cortex-M4 firmware.

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application using OpenOCD and GDB. The Solution proposed below
is based on the attach to a preloaded firmware, available only for a Linux
environment. The firmware must first be loaded by the Cortex®-A7. Developer
then attaches the debugger to the running Zephyr using OpenOCD.

Principle is to attach to the firmware already loaded by the Linux.

- Build the sample:

.. code-block:: console

  west build -b stm32mp157c_dk2 samples/hello_world

- Copy the firmware on the target filesystem, load it and start it (`stm32mp157c boot Cortex-M4 firmware`_).
- Attach to the target:

.. code-block:: console

  west attach
