Overview
********

The STM32 Nucleo-144 board provides an affordable and flexible way for users
to try out new concepts and build prototypes by choosing from the various combinations
of performance and power consumption features, provided by the STM32 microcontroller.

The ST Zio connector, which extends the ARDUINO® Uno V3 connectivity, and
the ST morpho headers provide an easy means of expanding the functionality of the Nucleo
open development platform with a wide choice of specialized shields.
The STM32 Nucleo-144 board does not require any separate probe as it integrates

Other hardware features are not yet supported on this Zephyr port.

The default configuration can be found in the defconfig files:
:zephyr_file:`boards/st/nucleo_h7s3l8/nucleo_h7s3l8_defconfig`

For more details please refer to `STM32H7R/S Nucleo-144 board User Manual`_.

Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------

The Nucleo H7S3L8 board features a ST Zio connector (extended Arduino Uno V3)
and a ST morpho connector. Board is configured as follows:

- UART_3 TX/RX : PD8/PD9 (ST-Link Virtual Port Com)
- USER_PB : PC13
- LD1 : PD10
- LD2 : PD13
- LD3 : PB7
- I2C : PB8, PB9
- SPI1 NSS/SCK/MISO/MOSI : PD14PA5/PA6/PB5 (Arduino SPI)

System Clock
------------

Nucleo H7S3L8 System Clock could be driven by an internal or external
oscillator, as well as the main PLL clock. By default, the System clock is
driven by the PLL clock at 600MHz, driven by an 24MHz high-speed external clock.

Serial Port
-----------

Nucleo H7S3L8 board has 4 UARTs and 3 USARTs plus one LowPower UART. The Zephyr console
output is assigned to UART3. Default settings are 115200 8N1.

Backup SRAM
-----------

In order to test backup SRAM you may want to disconnect VBAT from VDD. You can
do it by removing ``SB13`` jumper on the back side of the board.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Nucleo H7S3L8 board includes an ST-LINK/V3 embedded debug tool interface.

.. note::

   Check if your ST-LINK V3 has newest FW version. It can be done with `STM32CubeProgrammer`_

Flashing
========

The board is configured to be flashed using west `STM32CubeProgrammer`_ runner,
so its :ref:`installation <stm32cubeprog-flash-host-tools>` is required.

Alternatively, OpenOCD or JLink can also be used to flash the board using
the ``--runner`` (or ``-r``) option:

.. code-block:: console

   $ west flash --runner openocd

Flashing an application to Nucleo H7S3L8
----------------------------------------

First, connect the NUCLEO-H7S3L8 to your host computer using
the USB port to prepare it for flashing. Then build and flash your application.

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

Run a serial host program to connect with your NUCLEO-H7S3L8 board.

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -b 115200 -D /dev/ttyACM0

or use screen:

.. code-block:: console

   $ screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200

Build and flash the application:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nucleo_h7s3l8
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   $ Hello World! nucleo_h7s3l8

Blinky example can also be used:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: nucleo_h7s3l8
   :goals: build flash

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nucleo_h7s3l8
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
