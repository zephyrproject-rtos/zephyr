Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``nucleo_l412rb_p`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

Nucleo L412RB-P board includes an ST-LINK/V2-1 embedded debug tool
interface.  This interface is supported by the openocd version
included in the Zephyr SDK since v0.9.2.

Flashing an application to Nucleo L412RB-P
------------------------------------------

Connect the Nucleo L412RB-P to your host computer using the USB port,
then run a serial host program to connect with your Nucleo board.

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

Now build and flash an application. Here is an example for
:ref:`hello_world`.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nucleo_l412rb_p
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   $ Hello World! nucleo_l412rb_p


Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
