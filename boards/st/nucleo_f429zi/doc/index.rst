System Clock
------------

The Nucleo F429ZI System Clock could be driven by an internal or external oscillator,
as well as by the main PLL clock. By default System clock is driven by PLL clock at 180MHz,
driven by an 8MHz high speed external clock.

Serial Port
-----------

The Nucleo F429ZI board has 8 UARTs. The Zephyr console output is assigned to UART3.
Default settings are 115200 8N1.


Programming and Debugging
*************************

The Nucleo F429ZI board includes an ST-LINK/V2-1 embedded debug tool interface.
This interface is supported by the openocd version included in Zephyr SDK.

Flash partitions for MCUBoot bootloader
***************************************

The on-board STM32F429ZI MCU has 2MBs of internal flash memory. To use `MCUboot`_,
define a :ref:`Zephyr partition table <flash_map_api>` for the flash memory in
its devicetree file ``nucleo_f429zi.dts``. As a reference, a partition table for
MCUBoot is already defined in the devicetree file, with these settings:

- `MCUBoot`_ bootloader partition takes 64K bytes.
- Zephyr settings partition takes 64K bytes.
- Application image takes 256K bytes in Slot 0 partition.
- Updating image takes another 256K bytes in Slot 1 partition.
- A scratch partition with 128K is required for image swap.

A specific application can adjust each partition size based on its needs.
