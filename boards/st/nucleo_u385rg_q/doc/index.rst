Programming and Debugging
*************************

.. zephyr:board-supported-runners::

Nucleo U385RG board includes an ST-LINK/V3 embedded debug tool interface.
This probe allows to flash the board using various tools.

Flashing
========

The board is configured to be flashed using west `STM32CubeProgrammer`_ runner,
so its :ref:`installation <stm32cubeprog-flash-host-tools>` is required.

Alternatively, JLink or pyOCD can also be used to flash the board using
the ``--runner`` (or ``-r``) option:

.. code-block:: console

   $ west flash --runner pyocd
   $ west flash --runner jlink

For pyOCD, additional target information needs to be installed
by executing the following pyOCD commands:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pyocd pack --update
   $ pyocd pack --install stm32u3


Flashing an application to Nucleo U385RG
----------------------------------------

Connect the Nucleo U385RG to your host computer using the USB port.
Then build and flash an application. Here is an example for the
:zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

Run a serial host program to connect with your Nucleo board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

Then build and flash the application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nucleo_u385rg_q
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! nucleo_u385rg_q

Debugging
=========

Default debugger for this board is OpenOCD. It can be used in the usual way.
Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: nucleo_u385rg_q
   :goals: debug

Note: Check the ``build/tfm`` directory to ensure that the commands required by these scripts
(``readlink``, etc.) are available on your system. Please also check ``STM32_Programmer_CLI``
(which is used for initialization) is available in the PATH.
