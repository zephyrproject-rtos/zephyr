Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

Connections and IOs
===================

Nucleo-H503RB board has 8 GPIO controllers. These controllers are responsible for pin muxing,
input/output, pull-up, etc.

For more details please refer to `STM32H5 Nucleo-64 board User Manual`_.

Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------

- USART1 TX/RX : PB14/PB15 (Arduino USART1)
- SPI1 SCK/MISO/MOSI/NSS: PA5/PA6/PA7/PC9
- USART3 TX/RX : PA3/PA4 (VCP)
- USER_PB : PC13
- User LED (green): PA5

System Clock
------------

Nucleo H533RE System Clock could be driven by internal or external oscillator,
as well as main PLL clock. By default System clock is driven by PLL clock at
240 MHz, driven by an 24 MHz high-speed external clock.

Serial Port
-----------

Nucleo H533RE board has up to 3 U(S)ARTs. The Zephyr console output is assigned
to USART3. Default settings are 115200 8N1.

Backup SRAM
-----------

In order to test backup SRAM, you may want to disconnect VBAT from VDD_MCU.
You can do it by removing ``SB38`` jumper on the back side of the board.
VBAT can be provided via the left ST Morpho connector's pin 33.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Nucleo-H503RB board includes an ST-LINK/V3EC embedded debug tool interface.
This probe allows to flash the board using various tools.

Applications for the ``nucleo_h503rb`` board can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

OpenOCD Support
===============

For now, openocd support  for stm32h5 is not available on upstream OpenOCD.
You can check `OpenOCD official Github mirror`_.
In order to use it though, you should clone from the customized
`STMicroelectronics OpenOCD Github`_ and compile it following usual README guidelines.
Once it is done, you can set the OPENOCD and OPENOCD_DEFAULT_PATH variables in
:zephyr_file:`boards/st/nucleo_h563zi/board.cmake` to point the build
to the paths of the OpenOCD binary and its scripts,  before
including the common openocd.board.cmake file:

   .. code-block:: none

      set(OPENOCD "<path_to_openocd_repo>/src/openocd" CACHE FILEPATH "" FORCE)
      set(OPENOCD_DEFAULT_PATH <path_to_opneocd_repo>/tcl)
      include(${ZEPHYR_BASE}/boards/common/openocd.board.cmake)

Flashing
========

The board is configured to be flashed using west `STM32CubeProgrammer`_ runner,
so its :ref:`installation <stm32cubeprog-flash-host-tools>` is required.

Alternatively, OpencOCD or pyOCD can also be used to flash the board using
the ``--runner`` (or ``-r``) option:

.. code-block:: console

   $ west flash --runner openocd
   $ west flash --runner pyocd

For pyOCD, additional target information needs to be installed
which can be done by executing the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pyocd pack --update
   $ pyocd pack --install stm32h5

Flashing an application to Nucleo-H503RB
----------------------------------------

Connect the Nucleo-H503RB to your host computer using the USB port.
Then build and flash an application. Here is an example for the
:zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

Run a serial host program to connect with your Nucleo board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

Then build and flash the application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nucleo_h503rb
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! nucleo_h503rb/stm32h503xx

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way. Here is an example for the
:zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: nucleo_h503rb
   :goals: debug
