.. zephyr:board:: nucleo_n657x0_q

Overview
********

The NUCLEO-N657X0-Q board provides an affordable and flexible way for users to try out
new concepts and build prototypes by choosing from the various combinations of performance
and power consumption features, provided by the STM32 microcontroller. For the compatible boards,
the internal or external SMPS significantly reduces power consumption in Run mode.

The ST Zio connector, which extends the ARDUINO速 Uno V3 connectivity, and the ST morpho headers
provide an easy means of expanding the functionality of the Nucleo open development platform with
a wide choice of specialized shields.

The NUCLEO-N657X0-Q board does not require any separate probe as it integrates the ST-LINK
debugger/programmer.

The STM32 Nucleo-144 board comes with the STM32 comprehensive free software libraries and
examples available with the STM32Cube MCU Package.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

NUCLEO-N657X0-Q board includes an ST-LINK/V3 embedded debug tool interface.
This probe allows to flash and debug the board using various tools.



Flashing or loading
===================

The board is configured to be programmed using west `STM32CubeProgrammer`_ runner,
so its :ref:`installation <stm32cubeprog-flash-host-tools>` is needed.
Version 2.18.0 or later of `STM32CubeProgrammer`_ is required.

To program the board, there are two options:

- Program the firmware in external flash. At boot, it will then be loaded on RAM
  and executed from there.
- Optionally, it can also be taken advantage from the serial boot interface provided
  by the boot ROM. In that case, firmware is directly loaded in RAM and executed from
  there. It is not retained.

Programming an application to NUCLEO-N657X0-Q
---------------------------------------------

Here is an example to build and run :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

First, connect the NUCLEO-N657X0-Q to your host computer using the ST-Link USB port.

   .. tabs::

      .. group-tab:: ST-Link

         Build and flash an application using ``nucleo_n657x0_q`` target.

         .. zephyr-app-commands::
            :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
            :board: nucleo_n657x0_q
            :goals: build flash

.. note::
            For flashing, before powering the board, set the boot pins in the following configuration:

            * BOOT0: 0
            * BOOT1: 1

            After flashing, to run the application, set the boot pins in the following configuration:

            * BOOT1: 0

	    Power off and on the board again.

         Run a serial host program to connect to your board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

      .. group-tab:: Serial Boot Loader (USB)

         Additionally, connect the NUCLEO-N657X0-Q to your host computer using the USB port.
         In this configuration, ST-Link is used to power the board and for serial communication
         over the Virtual COM Port.

         .. note::
            Before powering the board, set the boot pins in the following configuration:

            * BOOT0: 1
            * BOOT1: 0

         Build and load an application using ``nucleo_n657x0_q/stm32n657xx/sb`` target (you
         can also use the shortened form: ``nucleo_n657x0_q//sb``)

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nucleo_n657x0_q
   :goals: build flash


Run a serial host program to connect to your board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! nucleo_n657x0_q/stm32n657xx


Debugging
=========

For now debugging is only available through STM32CubeIDE:

* Go to File > Import and select C/C++ > STM32 Cortex-M Executable.
* In Executable field, browse to your <ZEPHYR_PATH>/build/zephyr/zephyr.elf.
* In MCU field, select STM32N657X0HxQ.
* Click on Finish.
* Finally, click on Debug to start the debugging session.

.. note::
   For debugging, before powering on the board, set the boot pins in the following configuration:

   * BOOT0: 0
   * BOOT1: 1


Running tests with twister
==========================

Due to the BOOT switches manipulation required when flashing the board using ``nucleo_n657x0_q``
board target, it is only possible to run twister tests campaign on ``nucleo_n657x0_q/stm32n657xx/sb``
board target which doesn't require BOOT pins changes to load and execute binaries.
To do so, it is advised to use Twister's hardware map feature with the following settings:

.. code-block:: yaml

   - platform: nucleo_n657x0_q/stm32n657xx/sb
     product: BOOT-SERIAL
     pre_script: <path_to_zephyr>/boards/st/common/scripts/board_power_reset.sh
     runner: stm32cubeprogrammer
