Zephyr board options
====================

The STM32U585i is an SoC with Cortex-M33 architecture. Zephyr provides support
for building for both Secure and Non-Secure firmware.

The BOARD options are summarized below:

+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| BOARD                         | Description                               |
+===============================+===========================================+
| b_u585i_iot02a                | For building Trust Zone Disabled firmware |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| b_u585i_iot02a/stm32u585xx/ns | For building Non-Secure firmware          |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+

Here are the instructions to build Zephyr with a non-secure configuration,
using `tfm_ipc_` sample:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ west build -b b_u585i_iot02a/stm32u585xx/ns samples/tfm_integration/tfm_ipc/

Once done, before flashing, you need to first run a generated script that
will set platform option bytes config and erase platform (among others,
option bit TZEN will be set).

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ ./build/tfm/api_ns/regression.sh
      $ west flash

Please note that, after having run a TFM sample on the board, you will need to
run `./build/tfm/api_ns/regression.sh` once more to clean up the board from secure
options and get back the platform back to a "normal" state and be able to run
usual, non-TFM, binaries.
Also note that, even then, TZEN will remain set, and you will need to use
STM32CubeProgrammer_ to disable it fully, if required.

Connections and IOs
===================

B_U585I_IOT02A Discovery kit has 9 GPIO controllers (from A to I). These controllers are responsible for pin muxing,
input/output, pull-up, etc.

For more details please refer to `B U585I IOT02A board User Manual`_.

Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------

- UART_1 TX/RX : PA9/PA10 (ST-Link Virtual Port Com)
- LD1 : PH7
- LD2 : PH6
- user button : PC13
- SPI1 NSS/SCK/MISO/MOSI : PE12/P13/P14/P15 (Arduino SPI)
- I2C_1 SDA/SDL : PB9/PB8 (Arduino I2C)
- I2C_2 SDA/SDL : PH5/PH4
- DAC1 CH1 : PA4 (STMOD+1)
- ADC1_IN15 : PB0
- USB OTG : PA11/PA12
- PWM4 : CN14 PB6
- PWM3 : CN4 PE4

System Clock
------------

B_U585I_IOT02A Discovery System Clock could be driven by an internal or external oscillator,
as well as the main PLL clock. By default the System clock is driven by the PLL clock at 80MHz,
driven by 16MHz high speed internal oscillator.

Serial Port
-----------

B_U585I_IOT02A Discovery kit has 4 U(S)ARTs. The Zephyr console output is assigned to UART1.
Default settings are 115200 8N1.


Backup SRAM
-----------

In order to test backup SRAM you may want to disconnect VBAT from VDD. You can
do it by removing ``SB6`` jumper on the back side of the board.


Programming and Debugging
*************************

B_U585I_IOT02A Discovery kit includes an ST-LINK/V3 embedded debug tool interface.
This probe allows to flash the board using various tools.


Flashing
========

Board is configured to be flashed using west STM32CubeProgrammer runner.
Installation of `STM32CubeProgrammer`_ is then required to flash the board.

Alternatively, openocd (provided in Zephyr SDK), JLink and pyocd can also be
used to flash and debug the board if west is told to use it as runner,
using ``-r openocd``.

Connect the B_U585I_IOT02A Discovery kit to your host computer using the USB
port, then run a serial host program to connect with your Discovery
board. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

Then, build and flash in the usual way. Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: b_u585i_iot02a
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! arm

Debugging
=========

Default flasher for this board is openocd. It could be used in the usual way.
Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: b_u585i_iot02a
   :goals: debug

Disabling TrustZone |reg| on the board
======================================

If you have flashed a sample to the board that enables TrustZone, you will need
to disable it before you can flash and run a new non-TrustZone sample on the
board.

To disable TrustZone, it's necessary to change AT THE SAME TIME the ``TZEN``
and ``RDP`` bits. ``TZEN`` needs to get set from 1 to 0 and ``RDP``,
needs to be set from ``DC`` to ``AA`` (step 3 below).

This is docummented in the `AN5347, in section 9`_, "TrustZone deactivation".

However, it's possible that the ``RDP`` bit is not yet set to ``DC``, so you
first need to set it to ``DC`` (step 2).

Finally you need to set the "Write Protection 1 & 2" bytes properly, otherwise
some memory regions won't be erasable and mass erase will fail (step 4).

The following command sequence will fully deactivate TZ:

Step 1:

Ensure U23 BOOT0 switch is set to 1 (switch is on the left, assuming you read
"BOOT0" silkscreen label from left to right). You need to press "Reset" (B2 RST
switch) after changing the switch to make the change effective.

Step 2:

.. code-block:: console

   $ STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=/dev/ttyACM0 -ob rdp=0xDC

Step 3:

.. code-block:: console

   $ STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=/dev/ttyACM0 -tzenreg

Step 4:

.. code-block:: console

   $ STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=/dev/ttyACM0 -ob wrp1a_pstrt=0x7f
   $ STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=/dev/ttyACM0 -ob wrp1a_pend=0x0
   $ STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=/dev/ttyACM0 -ob wrp1b_pstrt=0x7f
   $ STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=/dev/ttyACM0 -ob wrp1b_pend=0x0
   $ STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=/dev/ttyACM0 -ob wrp2a_pstrt=0x7f
   $ STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=/dev/ttyACM0 -ob wrp2a_pend=0x0
   $ STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=/dev/ttyACM0 -ob wrp2b_pstrt=0x7f
   $ STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=/dev/ttyACM0 -ob wrp2b_pend=0x0
