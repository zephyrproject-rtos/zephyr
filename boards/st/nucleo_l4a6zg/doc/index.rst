Connections and IOs
===================

Nucleo L4A6ZG Board has 8 GPIO controllers. These controllers are responsible for pin muxing,
input/output, pull-up, etc.

For more details please refer to `STM32 Nucleo-144 board User Manual`_.

Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------

- LPUART_1 TX/RX : PG7/PG8 (ST-Link Virtual COM Port)
- UART_3 TX/RX : PD8/PD9 (Arduino Serial)
- I2C_1 SCL/SDA : PB8/PB7 (Arduino I2C)
- SPI_1 SCK/MISO/MOSI/NSS : PA5/PA6/PA7/PD14 (Arduino SPI)
- USER_PB : PC13
- PWM_15_CH1 : PB14 (Red LED)
- LD1 : PC7 (Green LED)
- LD2 : PB7 (Blue LED)
- LD3 : PB14 (Red LED)

System Clock
------------

Nucleo L4A6ZG system clock could be driven by internal or external oscillator,
as well as main PLL clock. By default, system clock is driven by PLL at 80MHz, which is
driven by 16MHz high speed internal oscillator (HSI). High speed external oscillator
(HSE) is not soldered on the board, so it cannot be used to drive the PLL.

Serial Port
-----------

Nucleo L4A6ZG board has 5 UARTs. The Zephyr console output is assigned to LPUART1,
which is connected to the onboard ST-LINK/V2-1. Virtual COM port interface.
Default settings are 115200 8N1.


Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``nucleo_l4a6zg`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

Nucleo L4A6ZG board includes an ST-LINK/V2-1 embedded debug tool
interface. This interface is supported by the OpenOCD version
included in the Zephyr SDK since v0.9.5.

Flashing an application to Nucleo L4A6ZG
----------------------------------------

Connect the Nucleo L4A6ZG to your host computer using the ST-LINK USB port.
Then build and flash an application. Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

Run a serial host program to connect with your Nucleo board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0

Then build and flash the application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nucleo_l4a6zg
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! nucleo_l4a6zg

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nucleo_l4a6zg
