Hardware
********

STM32WB5MMG is an ultra-low-power and small form factor certified 2.4 GHz
wireless module. It supports Bluetooth |reg| Low Energy 5.4, Zigbee |reg| 3.0,
OpenThread, dynamic, and static concurrent modes, and 802.15.4 proprietary
protocols.

Based on the STMicroelectronics STM32WB55VGY wireless microcontroller,
STM32WB5MMG provides best-in-class RF performance thanks to its high
receiver sensitivity and output power signal. Its low-power features
enable extended battery life, small coin-cell batteries, and energy harvesting.

Supported Features
==================

The Zephyr STM32WB5MM-DK board configuration supports the following hardware features:

+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+
| Interface | Controller | Driver/Component                    |
+===========+============+=====================================+
| UART      | on-chip    | serial port-polling;                |
|           |            | serial port-interrupt               |
+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+
| I2C       | on-chip    | i2c                                 |
+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+


Other hardware features are not yet supported on this Zephyr port.

The default configuration can be found in the defconfig file:
:zephyr_file:`boards/st/stm32wb5mm_dk/stm32wb5mm_dk_defconfig`

Bluetooth and compatibility with STM32WB Copro Wireless Binaries
================================================================

To operate bluetooth on STM32WB5MMG, Cortex-M0 core should be flashed with
a valid STM32WB Coprocessor binaries (either 'Full stack' or 'HCI Layer').
These binaries are delivered in STM32WB Cube packages, under
``Projects/STM32WB_Copro_Wireless_Binaries/STM32WB5x/``.

For compatibility information with the various versions of these binaries,
please check `modules/hal/stm32/lib/stm32wb/hci/README`_
in the ``hal_stm32`` repo.

Note that since STM32WB Cube package V1.13.2, `"full stack"` binaries are not
compatible anymore for a use in Zephyr and only `"HCI Only"` versions should be
used on the M0 side.

Connections and IOs
===================


Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------

.. rst-class:: rst-columns

- UART_1 TX/RX : PB7/PB6 ( Connected to ST-Link VCP)
- LPUART_1 TX/RX : PA3/PA2
- USB : PA11/PA12
- SWD : PA13/PA14
- I2C3: SDA/SCL PB11/PB13 (Sensor I2C bus)

System Clock
------------

STM32WB5MMG System Clock could be driven by internal or external oscillator,
as well as main PLL clock. By default System clock is driven by HSE clock at 32MHz.

Serial Port
-----------

STM32WB5MM-DK board has 2 (LP)U(S)ARTs. The Zephyr console output is assigned to USART1.
Default settings are ``115200 8N1``.

LEDs
----
STM32WB5MM-DK has two types of LEDs, The resources coming from STM32WB5MMG are
shared between the RGB and IR LEDs. It is not possible to use them
simultaneously. The selection is done by JP4 and JP5 jumpers.
To use the RGB LED, JP5 must be ON and JP4 OFF. In this configuration,
GPIO_SELECT2 (PH1) is the chip select for this RGB device on SPI1.

Buttons
-------
STM32WB5MM-DK has two user buttons. The first button is mapped to PC12,
and the second to PC13. They have the aliases sw0 and sw1 respectively.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``stm32wb5mm_dk`` board configuration can be built the
usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application`).

Flashing
========

STM32WB5MM-DK has an on-board ST-Link to flash and debug the firmware on the
module.


Flashing ``hello_world`` application to STM32WB5MM-DK
------------------------------------------------------

Connect the STM32WB5MM-DK to your host computer using the USB port (CN11).
Then build and flash an application. Here is an example for the ``hello_world``
application.

Run a serial host program to connect with your  STM32WB5MM-DK board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

Then first build and flash the application for the STM32WB5MM-DK board.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32wb5mm_dk
   :goals: build flash

Reset the board and you should see the following messages on the console:

.. code-block:: console

	Hello World! stm32w5mm_dk

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
`Hello_World`_  application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32wb5mm_dk
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
