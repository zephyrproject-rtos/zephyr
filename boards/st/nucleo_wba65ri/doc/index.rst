Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

Bluetooth and IEEE 802.15.4 support
-----------------------------------

BLE and IEEE 802.15.4 support are enabled on nucleo_wba65ri. To build a zephyr sample using this board
you first need to install Bluetooth and/or IEEE 802.15.4 Controller libraries available in Zephyr as
binary blobs.

To fetch Binary Blobs:

.. code-block:: console

   west blobs fetch hal_stm32

Zephyr board options
====================

Zephyr supports building both Secure and Non-Secure firmware for
Nucleo WBA65RI board where TF-M is the embedded Secure firmware
and Zephyr the Non-Secure firmware.

The BOARD options are summarized below:

+---------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| BOARD                           | Description                              |
+=================================+==========================================+
| stm32wba65i_dk1                 | For building TrustZone Disabled firmware |
+---------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| stm32wba65i_dk1/stm32wba65xx/ns | For building Non-Secure firmware         |
+---------------------------------+------------------------------------------+

Here are the instructions to build Zephyr with a non-secure configuration,
using :zephyr:code-sample:`tfm_ipc` sample:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/tfm_integration/tfm_ipc
   :board: nucleo_wba65ri/stm32wba65xx/ns
   :goals: build

Once done, before flashing, you need to first run a generated script that
will set platform Option Bytes config and erase internal flash (among others,
Option Bit TZEN will be set).

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./build/tfm/api_ns/regression.sh
   $ west flash

Please note that, after having programmed the board for a TrustZone enabled system
(e.g. with ``./build/tfm/api_ns/regression.sh``), the SoC TZEN Option Byte is enabled
and you will need to operate specific sequence to disable this TZEN Option Byte
configuration to get your board back in normal state for booting with a TrustZone
disabled system (e.g. without TF-M support).
You can use STM32CubeProgrammer_ to disable the SoC TZEN Option Byte config. Refer
to `How to disable STM32WBA65 TZEN Option Byte`_.

Connections and IOs
===================

Nucleo WBA65RI Board has 4 GPIO controllers. These controllers are responsible for pin muxing,
input/output, pull-up, etc.

Nucleo WBA65RI System Clock could be driven by internal or external oscillator,
as well as main PLL clock. By default System clock is driven by HSE+PLL clock at 100MHz.

Serial Port
-----------

Nucleo WBA65RI board has 3 U(S)ARTs. The Zephyr console output is assigned to USART1.
Default settings are 115200 8N1.


Programming and Debugging
*************************

.. zephyr:board-supported-runners::

Nucleo WBA65RI board includes an ST-LINK/V3 embedded debug tool interface.
It could be used for flash and debug using either OpenOCD or STM32Cube ecosystem tools.

Flashing
========

The board is configured to be flashed using west `STM32CubeProgrammer`_ runner,
so its :ref:`installation <stm32cubeprog-flash-host-tools>` is required.

Alternatively, OpenOCD can also be used to flash the board using
the ``--runner`` (or ``-r``) option:

.. code-block:: console

   $ west flash --runner openocd

Flashing an application to Nucleo WBA65RI
-----------------------------------------

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: nucleo_wba65ri
   :goals: build flash

You will see the LED blinking every second.

Debugging
=========

Debugging using OpenOCD
-----------------------

You can debug an application in the usual way using OpenOCD. Here is an example for the
:zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: nucleo_wba65ri
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
