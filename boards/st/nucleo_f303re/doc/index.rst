The default configuration can be found in
:zephyr_file:`boards/st/nucleo_f303re/nucleo_f303re_defconfig`

Connections and IOs
===================

The Nucleo F303RE Board has 5 GPIO controllers. These controllers are
responsible for pin muxing, input/output, pull-up, etc.

Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------

The Nucleo F303RE board features an Arduino Uno V3 connector and a ST
morpho connector. Board is configured as follows:

- UART_2 TX/RX : PA2/PA3 (ST-Link Virtual Port Com)
- USER_PB   : PC13
- LD2       : PA5

System Clock
------------

The Nucleo F303RE System Clock can be driven by an internal or
external oscillator, as well as by the main PLL clock. By default the
System Clock is driven by the PLL clock at 72 MHz. The input to the
PLL is an 8 MHz external clock supplied by the processor of the
on-board ST-LINK/V2-1 debugger/programmer.

Serial Port
-----------

The Nucleo F303RE board has 2 UARTs. The Zephyr console output is assigned
to UART2.  Default settings are 115200 8N1.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

The Nucleo F303RE board includes an ST-LINK/V2-1 embedded debug tool interface.
This interface is supported by the openocd version included in Zephyr SDK.
