ST Nucleo L452RE
################

Overview
********

The Nucleo L452RE(-P) boards feature an ARM Cortex-M4 based STM32L452RE MCU
with a wide range of connectivity support and configurations. There are two variants:

- ST Nucleo L452RE
- ST Nucleo L452RE-P

Here some highlights of these boards:

- STM32 microcontroller in LQFP64 package
- Arduino Uno V3 connectivity
- On-board ST-LINK/V2-1 debugger/programmer with SWD connector
- Flexible board power supply:

  - USB VBUS or external source(3.3V, 5V, 7 - 12V)
  - Power management access point

- Three LEDs: USB communication (LD1), user LED (LD2), power LED (LD3)
- One push-button: RESET

The main difference between the ST Nucleo L452RE and the L452RE-P (note the missing
"-P" at the end) lays in the External Switched Mode Power Supply (SMPS) included in
the P series.

More information about the boards can be found at the `Nucleo L452RE website`_ and
the `Nucleo L452RE-P website`_.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``nucleo_l452re`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

Nucleo L452RE board includes an ST-LINK/V2-1 embedded debug tool
interface.  This interface is supported by the openocd version
included in the Zephyr SDK since v0.9.2.

Flashing an application to Nucleo L452RE
----------------------------------------

Connect the Nucleo L452RE to your host computer using the USB port,
then run a serial host program to connect with your Nucleo board.

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

Now build and flash an application. Here is an example for
:ref:`hello_world`.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nucleo_l452re
   :goals: build flash

For Nucleo L452RE-P, use this command instead:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nucleo_l452re/stm32l452xx/p
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   $ Hello World! arm


Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nucleo_l452re
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
