Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------

The Nucleo F302R8 board features an Arduino Uno V3 connector and a ST
morpho connector. Board is configured as follows:

- UART_2 TX/RX : PA2/PA3 (ST-Link Virtual Port Com)
- UART_3 TX/RX : PC10/PC11
- I2C1 SCL/SDA : PB8/PB9 (Arduino I2C)

System Clock
------------

The Nucleo F302R8 System Clock can be driven by an internal or
external oscillator, as well as by the main PLL clock. By default the
System Clock is driven by the PLL clock at 72 MHz. The input to the
PLL is an 8 MHz external clock supplied by the processor of the
on-board ST-LINK/V2-1 debugger/programmer.

Serial Port
-----------

The Nucleo F302R8 board has 3 UARTs. The Zephyr console output is assigned
to UART2.  Default settings are 115200 8N1.


Programming and Debugging
*************************

The Nucleo F302R8 board includes an ST-LINK/V2-1 embedded debug tool interface.
This interface is supported by the openocd version included in Zephyr SDK.
