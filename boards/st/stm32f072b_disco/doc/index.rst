- Board power supply: through USB bus or from an external 5 V supply voltage
- External application power supply: 3 V and 5 V

- Six LEDs:

  - LD1 (red/green) for USB communication
  - LD2 (red) for 3.3 V power on
  - Four user LEDs: LD3 (orange), LD4 (green), LD5 (red) and LD6 (blue)

- Two push-buttons: USER and RESET
- USB USER with Mini-B connector
- L3GD20, ST MEMS motion sensor, 3-axis digital output gyroscope
- One linear touch sensor or four touch keys
- RF EEprom daughter board connector

Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

.. note:: CAN feature requires CAN transceiver, such as `SK Pang CAN breakout board`_.

Pin Mapping
===========

STM32F072B-DISCO Discovery kit has 6 GPIO controllers. These controllers are
responsible for pin muxing, input/output, pull-up, etc.

For more details please refer to `STM32F072B-DISCO board User Manual`_.

System Clock
============

STM32F072B-DISCO System Clock could be driven by internal or external
oscillator, as well as main PLL clock. By default System clock is driven
by PLL clock at 72 MHz, driven by internal 8 MHz oscillator.

Serial Port
===========

STM32F072B-DISCO Discovery kit has up to 4 UARTs. The Zephyr console output
is assigned to UART 1. Default settings are 115200 8N1.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

STM32F072B-DISCO board includes an ST-LINK/V2 embedded debug tool interface.

Applications for the ``stm32f072b_disco`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

The board is configured to be flashed using west `STM32CubeProgrammer`_ runner,
so its :ref:`installation <stm32cubeprog-flash-host-tools>` is required.

Alternatively, OpenOCD or JLink can also be used to flash the board using
the ``--runner`` (or ``-r``) option:

.. code-block:: console

   $ west flash --runner openocd
   $ west flash --runner jlink

Flashing an application to STM32F072B-DISCO
-------------------------------------------

First, connect the STM32F072B-DISCO Discovery kit to your host computer using
the USB port to prepare it for flashing. Then build and flash your application.

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32f072b_disco
   :goals: build flash

Run a serial host program to connect with your board. A TTL(3.3V) serial
adapter is required.

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/<tty device>

Replace <tty_device> with the port where the serial adapter can be found.
For example, under Linux, /dev/ttyUSB0.

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! arm


Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32f072b_disco
   :goals: debug
