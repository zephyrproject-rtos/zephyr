Pin Mapping
===========

STM32F072B-DISCO Discovery kit has 6 GPIO controllers. These controllers are
responsible for pin muxing, input/output, pull-up, etc.

For more details please refer to `STM32F072B-DISCO board User Manual`_.

oscillator, as well as main PLL clock. By default System clock is driven
by PLL clock at 72 MHz, driven by internal 8 MHz oscillator.

Serial Port
===========

STM32F072B-DISCO Discovery kit has up to 4 UARTs. The Zephyr console output
is assigned to UART 1. Default settings are 115200 8N1.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``stm32f072b_disco`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

STM32F072B-DISCO board includes an ST-LINK/V2 embedded debug tool interface.
This interface is supported by the openocd version included in the Zephyr SDK.


Flashing an application to STM32F072B-DISCO
-------------------------------------------

First, connect the STM32F072B-DISCO Discovery kit to your host computer using
the USB port to prepare it for flashing. Then build and flash your application.

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32f072b_disco
   :goals: build flash

Run a serial host program to connect with your board. A TTL(3.3V) serial
adapter is required.

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/<tty device>

Replace <tty_device> with the port where the serial adapter can be found.
For example, under Linux, /dev/ttyUSB0.

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! arm


Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32f072b_disco
   :goals: debug
