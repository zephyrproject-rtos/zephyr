Pin Mapping
===========

STM32F769I Discovery kit has 9 GPIO controllers. These controllers are responsible for pin muxing,
input/output, pull-up, etc.

For more details please refer to `32F769I-DISCO board User Manual`_.

Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:

System Clock
============

The STM32F769I System Clock can be driven by an internal or external oscillator,
as well as by the main PLL clock. By default, the System clock is driven by the PLL
clock at 216MHz, driven by a 25MHz high speed external clock.

Serial Port
===========

The STM32F769I Discovery kit has up to 8 UARTs. The Zephyr console output is assigned to UART1
which connected to the onboard ST-LINK/V2 Virtual COM port interface. Default communication
settings are 115200 8N1.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``stm32f769i_disco`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

STM32F769I Discovery kit includes an ST-LINK/V2 embedded debug tool interface.
This interface is supported by the openocd version included in the Zephyr SDK.

Flashing an application to STM32F769I
-------------------------------------------

First, connect the STM32F769I Discovery kit to your host computer using
the USB port to prepare it for flashing. Then build and flash your application.

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32f769i_disco
   :goals: build flash

Run a serial host program to connect with your board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! arm

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32f769i_disco
   :goals: debug
