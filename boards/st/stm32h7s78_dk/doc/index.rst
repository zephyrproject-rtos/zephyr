Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``stm32h7s78_dk`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

STM32H7S78-DK Discovery board includes an ST-LINK/V3E embedded debug tool
interface. Support is available on STM32CubeProgrammer V2.13.0.

Alternatively, this interface will be supported by a next openocd version.

Flashing an application to STM32H7S78-DK Discovery
--------------------------------------------------

Connect the STM32H7S78-DK Discovery to your host computer using the USB port.
Then build and flash an application. Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

Run a serial host program to connect with your Nucleo board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

Then build and flash the application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32h7s78_dk
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! stm32h7s78_dk

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
