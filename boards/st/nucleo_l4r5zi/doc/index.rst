Nucleo L4R5ZI System Clock could be driven by internal or external
oscillator, as well as main PLL clock. By default, the System clock is
driven by the PLL clock at 80MHz, driven by a 16MHz high speed
internal oscillator. The clock can be boosted to 120MHz if boost mode
is selected.

Serial Port
-----------

Nucleo L4R5ZI board has 5 U(S)ARTs. The Zephyr console output is
assigned to UART2.  Default settings are 115200 8N1.

Network interface
-----------------

Ethernet over USB is configured as the default network interface (EEM)

Programming and Debugging
*************************

The NUCLEO-L4R5ZI board includes a ST-LINK/V2 embedded debug tool interface.

The board is configured to be flashed using west `STM32CubeProgrammer`_ runner,
so its installation is required to be able to flash the board.

Alternatively, openocd (provided in Zephyr SDK) or JLink can also be used to
flash the board using the ``--runner`` (or ``-r``) option:

.. code-block:: console

   $ west flash --runner openocd
   $ west flash --runner jlink

Connect the Nucleo L4R5ZI to your host computer using the USB port.
Then build and flash an application.

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

Run a serial host program to connect with your Nucleo board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

Then build and flash the application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nucleo_l4r5zi
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! arm
