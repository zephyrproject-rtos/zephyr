Pin Mapping
===========

STM32F072-EVAL Discovery kit has 6 GPIO controllers. These controllers are responsible for pin muxing,
input/output, pull-up, etc.

For more details please refer to STM32F072-EVAL board User Manual.

Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------
- UART_2_TX : PD5
- UART_2_RX : PD6
- TAMPER_PB : PC13
- JOYSTICK_RIGHT_PB : PE3
- JOYSTICK_LEFT_PB : PF2
- JOYSTICK_UP_PB : PF9
- JOYSTICK_DOWN_PB : PF10
- JOYSTICK_SEL_PB : PA0
- LD1 : PD8
- LD2 : PD9
- LD3 : PD10
- LD4 : PD11

System Clock
============

STM32F072-EVAL System Clock could be driven by an internal or external oscillator,
as well as the main PLL clock. By default the System clock is driven by the PLL clock at 48MHz,
driven by an 8MHz high speed internal clock.

Serial Port
===========

STM32F072-EVAL Discovery kit has up to 4 UARTs. The Zephyr console output is assigned to UART2.
Default settings are 115200 8N1.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``stm32f072_eval`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

STM32F072-EVAL Discovery kit includes an ST-LINK/V2 embedded debug tool interface.
This interface is supported by the openocd version included in Zephyr SDK.

Flashing an application to STM32F072-EVAL
-------------------------------------------

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: stm32f072_eval
   :goals: build flash

You will see the LED blinking every second.

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: stm32f072_eval
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
