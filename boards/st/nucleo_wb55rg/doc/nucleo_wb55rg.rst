The default configuration can be found in the defconfig file:
:zephyr_file:`boards/st/nucleo_wb55rg/nucleo_wb55rg_defconfig`

Bluetooth and compatibility with STM32WB Copro Wireless Binaries
================================================================

To operate bluetooth on Nucleo WB55RG, Cortex-M0 core should be flashed with
a valid STM32WB Coprocessor binaries (either 'Full stack' or 'HCI Layer').
These binaries are delivered in STM32WB Cube packages, under
Projects/STM32WB_Copro_Wireless_Binaries/STM32WB5x/
For compatibility information with the various versions of these binaries,
please check `modules/hal/stm32/lib/stm32wb/hci/README <https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/hal_stm32/blob/main/lib/stm32wb/hci/README>`__
in the hal_stm32 repo.
Note that since STM32WB Cube package V1.13.2, "full stack" binaries are not compatible
anymore for a use in Zephyr and only "HCI Only" versions should be used on the M0
side.

Connections and IOs
===================

Nucleo WB55RG Board has 6 GPIO controllers. These controllers are responsible for pin muxing,
input/output, pull-up, etc.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``nucleo_wb55rg`` board configuration can be built the
usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application`).

Flashing
========

Nucleo WB55RG board includes an ST-LINK/V2-1 embedded debug tool
interface.  This interface is supported by the openocd version included in the
Zephyr SDK since v0.11.0.

If you prefer, you can use pyocd, but it requires to enable "pack" support with
the following pyocd command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pyocd pack --update
   $ pyocd pack --install stm32wb55rg


Flashing an application to Nucleo WB55RG
----------------------------------------

Connect the Nucleo WB55RG to your host computer using the USB port.
Then build and flash an application. Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

Run a serial host program to connect with your Nucleo board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0

Then build and flash the application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nucleo_wb55rg
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! arm

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: nucleo_wb55rg
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
