Supported Features
==================

The Zephyr stm32f4_disco board configuration supports the following hardware features:

+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+
| Interface | Controller | Driver/Component                    |
+===========+============+=====================================+
| NVIC      | on-chip    | nested vector interrupt controller  |
+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+
| UART      | on-chip    | serial port-polling;                |
|           |            | serial port-interrupt               |
+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+
| PINMUX    | on-chip    | pinmux                              |
+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+
| GPIO      | on-chip    | gpio                                |
+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+
| PWM       | on-chip    | pwm                                 |
+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+

+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+
| CAN       | on-chip    | CAN controller                      |
+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+

.. note:: CAN feature requires CAN transceiver, such as `SK Pang CAN breakout board`_.
          Zephyr default configuration uses CAN_2 exclusively, as simultaneous use
          of CAN_1 and CAN_2 is not yet supported.

Other hardware features are not yet supported on Zephyr porting.

The default configuration can be found in
:zephyr_file:`boards/st/stm32f4_disco/stm32f4_disco_defconfig`


Pin Mapping
===========

STM32F4DISCOVERY Discovery kit has 8 GPIO controllers. These controllers are responsible for pin muxing,
input/output, pull-up, etc.

For more details please refer to `STM32F4DISCOVERY board User Manual`_.

Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------

.. rst-class:: rst-columns

- UART_1_TX : PB6
- UART_1_RX : PB7
- UART_2_TX : PA2
- UART_2_RX : PA3
- USER_PB : PA0
- LD3 : PD13
- LD4 : PD12
- LD5 : PD14
- LD6 : PD15
- USB DM : PA11
- USB DP : PA12
- CAN1_RX : PB8
- CAN1_TX : PB9
- CAN2_RX : PB5
- CAN2_TX : PB13

System Clock
============

STM32F4DISCOVERY System Clock could be driven by internal or external oscillator,
as well as main PLL clock. By default System clock is driven by PLL clock at 168MHz,
driven by 8MHz high speed external clock.

Serial Port
===========

STM32F4DISCOVERY Discovery kit has up to 6 UARTs. The Zephyr console output is assigned to UART2.
Default settings are 115200 8N1.
Please note that ST-Link Virtual Com Port is not wired to chip serial port. In order to
enable console output you should use a serial cable and connect it to UART2 pins (PA2/PA3).


Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``stm32f4_disco`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

STM32F4DISCOVERY Discovery kit includes an ST-LINK/V2 embedded debug tool interface.
This interface is supported by the openocd version included in Zephyr SDK.

Flashing an application to STM32F4DISCOVERY
-------------------------------------------

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application.

Run a serial host program to connect with your board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

Build and flash the application:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: stm32f4_disco
   :goals: build flash

You should see user led "LD4" blinking.

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32f4_disco
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
