Other hardware features are not yet supported in this Zephyr port.

The default configuration can be found in
:zephyr_file:`boards/st/nucleo_c031c6/nucleo_c031c6_defconfig`

Connections and IOs
===================

Each of the GPIO pins can be configured by software as output (push-pull or open-drain), as
input (with or without pull-up or pull-down), or as peripheral alternate function. Most of the
GPIO pins are shared with digital or analog alternate functions. All GPIOs are high current
capable except for analog inputs.

Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------

- UART_2 TX/RX : PA2/PA3 (ST-Link Virtual Port Com)
- LD4       : PA5

For more details please refer to `STM32 Nucleo-64 board User Manual`_.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``nucleo_c031c6`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

Nucleo C031C6 board includes an ST-LINK/V2-1 embedded debug tool interface.

Flashing an application to Nucleo C031C6
----------------------------------------

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: nucleo_c031c6
   :goals: build flash

You will see the LED blinking every second.
