System Clock
============

The STM32H7B3I System Clock can be driven by an internal or external oscillator,
as well as by the main PLL clock. By default, the System clock is driven
by the PLL clock at 280MHz. PLL clock is fed by a 24MHz high speed external clock.

Serial Port
===========

The STM32H7B3I Discovery kit has up to 10 UARTs. The Zephyr console output is assigned
to UART1 which is connected to the onboard STLINK-V3E. Virtual COM port interface
default communication settings are 115200 8N1.


Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``stm32h7b3i_dk`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

STM32H7B3I Discovery kit includes an STLINK-V3E embedded debug tool interface.
This interface is supported by the openocd version included in the Zephyr SDK.

Flashing may depend on the SoC option bytes configuration, which can be checked and
updated using `STM32CubeProgrammer`_.

Flashing an application to STM32H7B3I
-------------------------------------

First, connect the STM32H7B3I Discovery kit to your host computer using
the USB port to prepare it for flashing. Then build and flash your application.

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32h7b3i_dk
   :goals: build flash

Run a serial host program to connect with your board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! arm

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32h7b3i_dk
   :goals: debug

.. [#] To use CAN, solder bridges SB3, SB4 and SB5 need to be connected.
       Take note that CANFD pins are shared with STMOD+ connector (P1), so please check
       `STM32H7B3I_DK board schematics`_ for possible collisions if using that connector.
