ST ST25DV Discovery, MB1283 version
###################################

Overview
********

The ST25DV04K device is a dynamic NFC/RFID tag IC with a dual interface. It embeds a
4 Kbits EEPROM memory. It can be operated from an I2C interface, or by a 13.56 MHz
RFID reader, or by a NFC phone. The ST25DV04K Class 5 antenna daughter card, included
in the kit, can be replaced by Class 1 or Class 6 antennas.

The ST25DV-DISCOVERY is a demonstration kit to evaluate the features and capabilities
of the ST25DV series.
It is based on the NFC ST25DV04K device embedded on a daughter card using a Class 5 antenna
and a STM32 processor driving a mother board.

Hardware
********

The ST25DV Discovery kit provides the following hardware components:

- Main board: ST25DV_Discovery_Mboard:

  - STM32F405VGT6 LQFP100 32-bit microcontroller, with 1 Mbyte Flash memory, 192 + 4 Kbytes SRAM.
  - LCD color screen (320 x 200 pixels)
  - Touch screen driver
  - Different color LEDs (power, user, ST link)
  - User push button
  - Joystick for menu selection
  - Reset button
  - On board ST link for microcontroller firmware upgrade and debug
  - ST link mini USB
  - User micro USB
  - USB micro or mini connector for board powering
  - Demonstration edition (optional add-on module) with Bluetooth Low Energy module,
    Wi-Fi Â® module and JTAG 20 pin connector

It exists in two variants, MB1283 and MB1285.

- Antenna daughter board: ST25DV_Discovery_ANT_C5:

  - 40 mm x 24 mm, 13.56 MHz inductive antenna etched on the PCB
  - ST25DV04K Dynamic NFC / RFID tag
  - I 2 C interface connector
  - Energy harvesting output (VOUT) with a 10nF capacitance filtering circuit
  - GPO configurable as RF WIP/BUSY output, to indicate that an RF operation is ongoing

The antenna board can be removed, and its 14-pin 0.254mm header connector used as an eval kit header.

Connections and IOs
===================

Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping
---------------------------------

- UART_6 TX/RX : PC6/PC7 (ST-Link Virtual Port Com)
- UART_2 TX/RX : PA2/PA3 (Available on J6 connector)
- I2C1 SCL/SDA : PB6/PB7 (Touchscreen STMPE811, interrupt pin PB5)
- SPI2 SCK/MOSI/CS : PB13/PC3/PB12 (LCD display FRD24048TP, reset pin PC1, DC pin PC0)
- SPI1 SCK/MISO/MOSI/CS : PA5/PA6/PA7/PA4 (External ST25DV connector J6)

- LD1 : PC13 (Orange led)
- LD2 : PC4 (Yellow led)
- GPIO : PE15/PE7 (Available on external ST25DV connector J6)
- GPIO : PE14 (Available on J5 connector)

Serial Port
===========

The Zephyr console output and shell are assigned to UART6, which is connected to the
onboard ST-LINK/V2 Virtual COM port interface.
Default communication settings are 115200 8N1.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``st25dv_mb1283_disco`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

If programming fails, press the reset button (black) and release it while "west flash" is running.

Flashing
========

ST25DV Discovery kit includes an ST-LINK/V2 embedded debug tool interface.
This interface is supported by the openocd version included in the Zephyr SDK.

Flashing an application to ST25DV Discovery
--------------------------------------------

First, connect the ST25DV Discovery kit to your host computer using
the USB port to prepare it for flashing. Then build and flash your application.

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: st25dv_mb1283_disco
   :goals: build flash

Run a serial host program to connect with your board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! st25dv_mb1283_disco

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way. Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: st25dv_mb1283_disco
   :goals: debug
