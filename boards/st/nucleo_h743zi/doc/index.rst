ST Nucleo H743ZI
################

Overview
********

The STM32 Nucleo-144 boards offer combinations of performance and power that
provide an affordable and flexible way for users to build prototypes and try
out new concepts. For compatible boards, the SMPS (Switched-Mode Power Supply)
significantly reduces power consumption in Run mode.

The Arduino-compatible ST Zio connector expands functionality of the Nucleo
open development platform, with a wide choice of specialized Arduino* Uno V3
shields.

The STM32 Nucleo-144 board does not require any separate probe as it integrates
the ST-LINK/V2-1 debugger/programmer.

The STM32 Nucleo-144 board comes with the STM32 comprehensive free software
libraries and examples available with the STM32Cube MCU Package.

Other hardware features are not yet supported on this Zephyr port.

The default configuration can be found in the defconfig file:
:zephyr_file:`boards/st/nucleo_h743zi/nucleo_h743zi_defconfig`

For more details please refer to `STM32 Nucleo-144 board User Manual`_.

Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------

The Nucleo H743ZI board features a ST Zio connector (extended Arduino Uno V3)
and a ST morpho connector. Board is configured as follows:

- UART_3 TX/RX : PD8/PD9 (ST-Link Virtual Port Com)
- USER_PB : PC13
- LD1 : PB0
- LD2 : PB7
- LD3 : PB14
- I2C : PB8, PB9
- ADC1_INP15 : PA3
- DAC1_OUT1 : PA4
- ETH : PA1, PA2, PA7, PB13, PC1, PC4, PC5, PG11, PG13
- SPI1 NSS/SCK/MISO/MOSI : PD14/PA5/PA6/PB5 (Arduino SPI)
- CAN/CANFD : PD0, PD1

System Clock
------------

Nucleo H743ZI System Clock could be driven by an internal or external
oscillator, as well as the main PLL clock. By default, the System clock is
driven by the PLL clock at 96MHz, driven by an 8MHz high-speed external clock.

Serial Port
-----------

Nucleo H743ZI board has 4 UARTs and 4 USARTs. The Zephyr console output is
assigned to UART3. Default settings are 115200 8N1.

Backup SRAM
-----------

In order to test backup SRAM you may want to disconnect VBAT from VDD. You can
do it by removing ``SB156`` jumper on the back side of the board.

CAN, CANFD
----------

Requires an external CAN or CANFD transceiver.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``nucleo_h743zi`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

.. note::

   If using OpenOCD you will need a recent development version as the last
   official release does not support H7 series yet. You can also choose the
   ``stm32cubeprogrammer`` runner.

Flashing
========

Nucleo H743ZI board includes an ST-LINK/V2-1 embedded debug tool interface.

Flashing an application to Nucleo H743ZI
----------------------------------------

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

Run a serial host program to connect with your Nucleo board.

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -b 115200 -D /dev/ttyACM0

Build and flash the application:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nucleo_h743zi
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   $ Hello World! nucleo_h743zi

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nucleo_h743zi
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
