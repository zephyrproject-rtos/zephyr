Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``nucleo_wl55jc`` board configuration can be built the
usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application`).

Flashing
========

Nucleo WL55JC board includes an STLINK-V3 embedded debug tool
interface.  This interface is supported by the openocd version included in the
Zephyr SDK since v0.11.0.
You can also choose the ``stm32cubeprogrammer`` runner.


Flashing an application to Nucleo WL55JC
----------------------------------------

Connect the Nucleo WL55JC to your host computer using the USB port.
Then build and flash an application. Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

Run a serial host program to connect with your Nucleo board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0

Then build and flash the application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nucleo_wl55jc
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! arm

.. Note:

   Nucleo WL55JC board is provided with a stock firmware which demonstrates
   sleep mode. Unfortunately, default openocd configuration, which is debug
   compatible, doesn't allow flashing when SoC is in sleep mode.
   As a consequence, when flashing Nucleo WL55JC board over a stock firmware,
   please update board's openocd.cfg configuration file to select sleep mode
   compatible configuration.

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: nucleo_wl55jc
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
