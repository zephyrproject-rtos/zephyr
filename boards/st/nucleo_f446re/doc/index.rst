Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------

- UART_1_TX : PB6
- UART_1_RX : PB7
- UART_2_TX : PA2
- UART_2_RX : PA3
- USER_PB   : PC13
- LD2       : PA5
- I2C1_SDA  : PB9
- I2C1_SCL  : PB8
- I2C2_SDA  : PB3
- I2C2_SCL  : PB10
- I2C3_SDA  : PB4
- I2C3_SCL  : PA8

System Clock
------------

Nucleo F446RE System Clock could be driven by an internal or external oscillator,
as well as the main PLL clock. By default, the System clock is driven by the PLL clock at 84MHz,
driven by an 8MHz high-speed external clock.

Serial Port
-----------

Nucleo F446RE board has 2 UARTs and 4 USARTs. The Zephyr console output is assigned to UART2.
Default settings are 115200 8N1.

Backup SRAM
-----------

In order to test backup SRAM you may want to disconnect VBAT from VDD. You can
do it by removing ``SB45`` jumper on the back side of the board.

Controller Area Network
-----------------------

The TX/RX wires connected with D14/D15 of CN5 connector. Thus the board can be
used with `RS485 CAN Shield`_.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``nucleo_f446re`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

Nucleo F446RE board includes an ST-LINK/V2-1 embedded debug tool interface.
This interface is supported by the openocd version included in the Zephyr SDK.

Flashing an application to Nucleo F446RE
----------------------------------------

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

Run a serial host program to connect with your Nucleo board.

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -b 115200 -D /dev/ttyACM0

Build and flash the application:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nucleo_f446re
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   $ Hello World! arm

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nucleo_f446re
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
