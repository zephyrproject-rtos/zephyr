Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

Pin Mapping
===========

The peripherals of the HC32F4A0 SoC can be routed to various pins on the board.
The configuration of these routes can be modified through DTS. Please refer to
the datasheet to see the possible routings for each peripheral.

Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping
----------------------------------

- USART_1 TX/RX : PH15/PH13 (Virtual Port Com)
- LED11         : PC9
- K10/WKUP      : PA0

System Clock
------------

HC32F4A0_EVB System Clock could be driven by an internal or external oscillator,
 as well as the PLL clock. By default, the System clock is driven by the PLL
 clock at 240MHz, driven by an 8MHz high-speed external clock.

Serial Port
-----------

HC32F4A0_EVB board has 10 USARTs. The Zephyr console output is
assigned to UART1. Default settings are 115200 8N1.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

HC32F4A0_EVB board includes an XH-Link embedded debug tool interface.

Using XH-Link
=============

The HC32F4A0_EVB includes an onboard programmer/debugger (XH-Link) which
allow flash programming and debug over USB.

#. Build the Zephyr kernel and the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` sample
   application:

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
      :board: hc32f4a0_evb
      :goals: build
      :compact:

#. Run your favorite terminal program to listen for output. Under Linux the
   terminal should be :code:`/dev/ttyUSB0`. For example:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -o

   The -o option tells minicom not to send the modem initialization
   string. Connection should be configured as follows:

      - Speed: 115200
      - Data: 8 bits
      - Parity: None
      - Stop bits: 1

#. To flash an image:

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
      :board: hc32f4a0_evb
      :goals: flash
      :compact:

   You should see "Hello World! hc32f4a0_evb/hc32f4a0" in your terminal.

#. To debug an image:

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
      :board: hc32f4a0_evb
      :goals: debug
      :compact:
