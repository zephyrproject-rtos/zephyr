Programming and Debugging
*************************

Flashing
========

The flash on board is not supported by Zephyr at this time.
Board is booted over PCIe interface.

Debugging
=========
The ``bcm958402m2/bcm58402/a72`` board includes pads for soldering a JTAG connector.
Zephyr applications running on the Cortex-A72 core can also be tested
by observing UART console output.
