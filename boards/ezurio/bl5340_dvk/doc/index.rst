Overview
********
The BL5340 Development Kit provides support for the Ezurio
BL5340 module which is powered by a dual-core Nordic Semiconductor
nRF5340 ARM Cortex-M33F CPU. The nRF5340 inside the BL5340 module is a
dual-core SoC based on the Arm® Cortex®-M33 architecture, with:

* a full-featured Arm Cortex-M33F core with DSP instructions, FPU, and
  Armv8-M Security Extension, running at up to 128 MHz, referred to as
  the **application core**
* a secondary Arm Cortex-M33 core, with a reduced feature set, running
  at a fixed 64 MHz, referred to as the **network core**.

The ``bl5340_dvk/nrf5340/cpuapp`` build target provides support for the application
core on the BL5340 module. The ``bl5340_dvk/nrf5340/cpunet`` build target provides
support for the network core on the BL5340 module. If ARM TrustZone is
used then the ``bl5340_dvk/nrf5340/cpuapp`` build target provides support for the
non-secure partition of the application core on the BL5340 module.

Security components
===================

- Implementation Defined Attribution Unit (`IDAU`_) on the application
  core. The IDAU is implemented with the System Protection Unit and is
  used to define secure and non-secure memory maps.  By default, all of
  the memory space (Flash, SRAM, and peripheral address space) is
  defined to be secure accessible only.
- Secure boot.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

The BL5340's application core supports the Armv8-M Security Extension.
Applications built for the ``bl5340_dvk/nrf5340/cpuapp`` board by default
boot in the Secure state.

The BL5340's network core does not support the Armv8-M Security
Extension. The IDAU may configure bus accesses by the network core to
have Secure attribute set; the latter allows to build and run Secure
only applications on the BL5340 module.

Building Secure/Non-Secure Zephyr applications with Arm |reg| TrustZone |reg|
=============================================================================

Applications on the BL5340 module may contain a Secure and a Non-Secure
firmware image for the application core. The Secure image can be built
using either Zephyr or `Trusted Firmware M`_ (TF-M). Non-Secure
firmware images are always built using Zephyr. The two alternatives are
described below.

.. note::

   By default the Secure image for BL5340's application core is
   built using TF-M.

Building the Secure firmware with TF-M
--------------------------------------

The process to build the Secure firmware image using TF-M and the
Non-Secure firmware image using Zephyr requires the following steps:

1. Build the Non-Secure Zephyr application
   for the application core using ``-DBOARD=bl5340_dvk/nrf5340/cpuapp/ns``.
   To invoke the building of TF-M the Zephyr build system requires the
   Kconfig option ``BUILD_WITH_TFM`` to be enabled, which is done by
   default when building Zephyr as a Non-Secure application.
   The Zephyr build system will perform the following steps automatically:

      * Build the Non-Secure firmware image as a regular Zephyr application
      * Build a TF-M (secure) firmware image
      * Merge the output image binaries together
      * Optionally build a bootloader image (MCUboot)

.. note::

   Depending on the TF-M configuration, an application DTS overlay may
   be required, to adjust the Non-Secure image Flash and SRAM starting
   address and sizes.

2. Build the application firmware for the network core using
   ``-DBOARD=bl5340_dvk/nrf5340/cpunet``.

Building the Secure firmware using Zephyr
-----------------------------------------

The process to build the Secure and the Non-Secure firmware images
using Zephyr requires the following steps:

1. Build the Secure Zephyr application for the application core
   using ``-DBOARD=bl5340_dvk/nrf5340/cpuapp`` and
   ``CONFIG_TRUSTED_EXECUTION_SECURE=y`` and ``CONFIG_BUILD_WITH_TFM=n``
   in the application project configuration file.
2. Build the Non-Secure Zephyr application for the application core
   using ``-DBOARD=bl5340_dvk/nrf5340/cpuapp/ns``.
3. Merge the two binaries together.
4. Build the application firmware for the network core using
   ``-DBOARD=bl5340_dvk/nrf5340/cpunet``.

When building a Secure/Non-Secure application for the BL5340's
application core, the Secure application will have to set the IDAU
(SPU) configuration to allow Non-Secure access to all CPU resources
utilized by the Non-Secure application firmware. SPU configuration
shall take place before jumping to the Non-Secure application.

Building a Secure only application
==================================

Build the Zephyr app in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application`
and :ref:`application_run`), using ``-DBOARD=bl5340_dvk/nrf5340/cpuapp`` for
the firmware running on the BL5340's application core, and using
``-DBOARD=bl5340_dvk/nrf5340/cpunet`` for the firmware running
on the BL5340's network core.

Flashing
========

Follow the instructions in the :ref:`nordic_segger` page to install
and configure all the necessary software. Further information can be
found in :ref:`nordic_segger_flashing`. Then you can build and flash
applications as usual (:ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

.. warning::

   The BL5340 has a flash read-back protection feature. When flash
   read-back protection is active, you will need to recover the chip
   before reflashing. If you are flashing with
   :ref:`west <west-build-flash-debug>`, run this command for more
   details on the related ``--recover`` option:

   .. code-block:: console

      west flash -H -r nrfjprog --skip-rebuild

.. note::

   Flashing and debugging applications on the BL5340 DVK requires
   upgrading the nRF Command Line Tools to version 10.12.0 or newer.
   Further information on how to install the nRF Command Line Tools can
   be found in :ref:`nordic_segger_flashing`.

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application running on the
BL5340's application core.

First, run your favorite terminal program to listen for output.

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D <tty_device> -b 115200

Replace :code:`<tty_device>` with the port where the BL5340 DVK board
can be found. For example, under Linux, :code:`/dev/ttyACM0`.

Then build and flash the application in the usual way.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: bl5340_dvk/nrf5340/cpuapp
   :goals: build flash

Debugging
=========

Refer to the :ref:`nordic_segger` page to learn about debugging
boards with a Segger IC.
