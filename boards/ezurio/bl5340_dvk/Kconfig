	  This option enables releasing the Network 'force off' signal, which
	  as a consequence will power up the Network MCU during system boot.
	  Additionally, the option allocates GPIO pins that will be used by UARTE
	  of the Network MCU.
	  Note: GPIO pin allocation can only be configured by the secure Application
	  MCU firmware, so when this option is used with the non-secure version of
	  the board, the application needs to take into consideration, that the
	  secure firmware image must already have configured GPIO allocation for the
	  Network MCU.
