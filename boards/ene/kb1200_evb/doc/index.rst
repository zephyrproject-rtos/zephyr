Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

System Clock
============

The KB1200 MCU is configured to use the 96Mhz internal oscillator with the
on-chip DPLL to generate a resulting EC clock rate of 96MHz/48MHz/24MHz/12MHz.
See Processor clock control register (refer 5.1 General Configuration)

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Flashing
========

If the correct headers are installed, this board supports SWD Debug Interface.

To flash with SWD, install the drivers for your programmer, for example:
SEGGER J-link's drivers are at https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/

Debugging
=========

Use SWD with a J-Link
