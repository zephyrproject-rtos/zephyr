############

Overview
********
The MAX32655FTHR is a rapid development platform to help engineers quickly implement
ultra low-power wireless solutions using MAX32655 Arm© Cortex®-M4F and Bluetooth® 5.2 Low Energy (LE).
The board also includes the MAX20303 PMIC for battery and power management.
The form factor is a small 0.9in x 2.6in dual-row header footprint that is compatible
with Adafruit Feather Wing peripheral expansion boards. The board includes a variety of peripherals,
such as a digital microphone, lowpower stereo audio CODEC, 128MB QSPI Flash, micro SD card connector,
RGB indicator LED, and pushbutton.
The MAX32655FTHR provides a power-optimized flexible platform for quick proof-of-concepts and
early software development to enhance time to market. Go to

Push Buttons
************
There are six pushbuttons on the MAX32655FTHR board

SW1
===
PMIC Power Button, when the board is powered on state, pressing
this button for 12 seconds performs a hard powerdown.
When the board is in a powered-off state, pressing this button powers on the board.
This button can also be read by MAX32655 firmware, PMIC_PFN2 signal connected to Port 0.13
is a buffered input of the button status. When the button is pressed, this signal goes to a logic-low
state.

SW2
===
User-programmable function button connected to
MAX32655 Port 0.2 through a debouncer IC.

SW3
===
User-programmable function button connected to
MAX32655 Port 0.3 through a debouncer IC.

SW4
===
Wake-up button connected to MAX32655 Port 3.1.

SW5
===
Resets the MAX32655 through RSTN input of the MAX32655.

SW6
===
DAPLink adapter button. Keep this button
pressed while applying power to the board to
put the MAX32625 DAPLink adapter on board
to MAINTENANCE mode for DAPLink firmware
updates.


LEDs
****
There are three RGB LEDs on the MAX32655FTHR board

LED1 (D1)
=========
Connected to the MAX32655FTHR GPIO ports.
This LED can be controlled by user firmware.
Port 0.18: Red color
Port 0.19: Green color
Port 0.26: Blue color

LED2 (D2)
=========
Connected to MAX20303 PMIC LEDx outputs.
These LEDs can be controlled through I2C commands.
They also can be configured as charge
status indicators by issuing I2C commands.

LED3 (D3)
=========
DAPLink adapter MAX32625 status LED.
Controlled by the DAPLink adapter and cannot be
used as a user LED.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Flashing
========

The MAX32625 microcontroller on the board is flashed with DAPLink firmware at the factory.
It allows debugging and flashing the MAX32655 Arm Core over USB.

Once the USB cable is connected to your host computer, then you can simply run the
``west flash`` command to write a firmware image into flash.

Debugging
=========

Please refer to the `Flashing`_ section and run the ``west debug`` command
instead of ``west flash``.
