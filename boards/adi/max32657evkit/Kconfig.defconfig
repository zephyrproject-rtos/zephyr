# Code Partition:
#
# For the secure version of the board the firmware is linked at the beginning
# of the flash, or into the code-partition defined in DT if it is intended to
# be loaded by MCUboot. If the secure firmware is to be combined with a non-
# secure image (TRUSTED_EXECUTION_SECURE=y), the secure FW image shall always
# be restricted to the size of its code partition.
#
# For the non-secure version of the board, the firmware
# must be linked into the code-partition (non-secure) defined in DT, regardless.
# Apply this configuration below by setting the Kconfig symbols used by
# the linker according to the information extracted from DT partitions.

# Workaround for not being able to have commas in macro arguments
