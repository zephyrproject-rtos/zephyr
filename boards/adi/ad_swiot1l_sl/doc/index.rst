Programming and Debugging
*************************

Flashing
========
The MAX32650 MCU can be flashed by connecting an external debug probe to the
SWD port. SWD debug can be accessed through the Cortex 10-pin connector, J3.
Logic levels are fixed to VDDIO (1.8V).

Once the debug probe is connected to your host computer, then you can simply run the
``west flash`` command to write a firmware image into flash.

.. note::

   This board uses OpenOCD as the default debug interface. You can also use
   a Segger J-Link with Segger's native tooling by overriding the runner,
   appending ``--runner jlink`` to your ``west`` command(s). The J-Link should
   be connected to the standard 2*5 pin debug connector (J3) using an
   appropriate adapter board and cable

Debugging
=========
Please refer to the `Flashing`_ section and run the ``west debug`` command
instead of ``west flash``.
