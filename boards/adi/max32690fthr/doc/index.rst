Programming and Debugging
*************************

Flashing
========

The MAX32690 MCU can be flashed by connecting an external debug probe to the
SWD port. SWD debug can be accessed through the Cortex 10-pin connector, J4.
Logic levels are fixed to VDDIO (1.8V).

Once the debug probe is connected to your host computer, then you can run the
``west flash`` command to write a firmware image into flash. Here is an example
for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: max32690fthr/max32690/m4
   :goals: flash

.. note::

   This board uses OpenOCD as the default debug interface. You can also use a
   Segger J-Link with Segger's native tooling by overriding the runner,
   appending ``--runner jlink`` to your ``west`` command(s). The J-Link should
   be connected to the standard 2*5 pin debug connector (J4) using an
   appropriate adapter board and cable.

Debugging
=========

Once the debug probe is connected to your host computer, then you can run the
``west debug`` command to write a firmware image into flash and start a debug
session. Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: max32690fthr/max32690/m4
   :goals: debug
