.. zephyr:board:: cy8cproto_063_ble

Overview
********

The PSOC 6 BLE Proto Kit (CY8CPROTO-063-BLE) is a hardware platform that
enables design and debug of the Cypress PSOC 63 BLE MCU.

Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

System Clock
============

The PSOC 63 BLE MCU SoC is configured to use the internal IMO+FLL as a source for
the system clock. CM0+ works at 50MHz, CM4 - at 100MHz. Other sources for the
system clock are provided in the SOC, depending on your system requirements.


Fetch Binary Blobs
******************

cy8cproto_063_ble board requires fetch binary files
(e.g Bluetooth controller firmware, CM0p prebuilt images, etc).

To fetch Binary Blobs:

.. code-block:: console

   west blobs fetch hal_infineon


Build blinking led sample
*************************

Here is an example for building the :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` sample application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: cy8cproto_063_ble
   :goals: build

Programming and Debugging
*************************

The CY8CPROTO-063-BLE includes an onboard programmer/debugger (`KitProg3`_) to provide debugging, flash programming, and serial communication over USB. Flash and debug commands use OpenOCD and require a custom Infineon OpenOCD version, that supports KitProg3, to be installed.

Infineon OpenOCD Installation
=============================

Both the full `ModusToolbox`_ and the `ModusToolbox Programming Tools`_ packages include Infineon OpenOCD. Installing either of these packages will also install Infineon OpenOCD. If neither package is installed, a minimal installation can be done by downloading the `Infineon OpenOCD`_ release for your system and manually extract the files to a location of your choice.

.. note:: Linux requires device access rights to be set up for KitProg3. This is handled automatically by the ModusToolbox and ModusToolbox Programming Tools installations. When doing a minimal installation, this can be done manually by executing the script ``openocd/udev_rules/install_rules.sh``.

West Commands
=============

The path to the installed Infineon OpenOCD executable must be available to the ``west`` tool commands. There are multiple ways of doing this. The example below uses a permanent CMake argument to set the CMake variable ``OPENOCD``.

   .. tabs::
      .. group-tab:: Windows

         .. code-block:: shell

            # Run west config once to set permanent CMake argument
            west config build.cmake-args -- -DOPENOCD=path/to/infineon/openocd/bin/openocd.exe

            # Do a pristine build once after setting CMake argument
            west build -b cy8cproto_063_ble -p always samples/basic/blinky

            west flash
            west debug

      .. group-tab:: Linux

         .. code-block:: shell

            # Run west config once to set permanent CMake argument
            west config build.cmake-args -- -DOPENOCD=path/to/infineon/openocd/bin/openocd

            # Do a pristine build once after setting CMake argument
            west build -b cy8cproto_063_ble -p always samples/basic/blinky

            west flash
            west debug
