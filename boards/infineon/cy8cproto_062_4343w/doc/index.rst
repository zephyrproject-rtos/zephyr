Overview
********

The CY8CPROTO-062-4343W PSOC 6 Wi-Fi BT Prototyping Kit is a low-cost hardware
platform that enables design and debug of PSOC 6 MCUs. It comes with a Murata
LBEE5KL1DX module, based on the CYW4343W combo device, industry-leading CAPSENSE
for touch buttons and slider, on-board debugger/programmer with KitProg3, microSD
card interface, 512-Mb Quad-SPI NOR flash, PDM-PCM microphone, and a thermistor.

This kit is designed with a snap-away form-factor, allowing the user to separate
the different components and features that come with this kit and use independently.
In addition, support for Digilent's Pmod interface is also provided with this kit.

Kit Features:
=============

- Support of up to 2MB Flash and 1MB SRAM
- Dedicated SDHC to interface with WICED wireless devices.
- Delivers dual-cores, with a 150-MHz Arm Cortex-M4 as the primary
  application processor and a 100-MHz Arm Cortex-M0+ as the secondary
  processor for low-power operations.
- Supports Full-Speed USB, capacitive-sensing with CAPSENSE, a PDM-PCM
  digital microphone interface, a Quad-SPI interface, 13 serial communication
  blocks, 7 programmable analog blocks, and 56 programmable digital blocks.

Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

System Clock
============

The PSOC 62 MCU SoC is configured to use the internal IMO+FLL as a source for
the system clock. CM0+ works at 50MHz, CM4 - at 100MHz. Other sources for the
system clock are provided in the SOC, depending on your system requirements.


Fetch Binary Blobs
******************

cy8cproto_062_4343w board optionally uses binary blobs for features
(e.g WIFI/Bluetooth chip firmware, CM0p prebuilt images, etc).

To fetch Binary Blobs:

.. code-block:: console

   west blobs fetch hal_infineon


Build blinking led sample
*************************

Here is an example for building the :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` sample application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: cy8cproto_062_4343w
   :goals: build

Programming and Debugging
*************************

The CY8CPROTO-062-4343W includes an onboard programmer/debugger (`KitProg3`_) to provide debugging, flash programming, and serial communication over USB. Flash and debug commands use OpenOCD and require a custom Infineon OpenOCD version, that supports KitProg3, to be installed.

Infineon OpenOCD Installation
=============================

Both the full `ModusToolbox`_ and the `ModusToolbox Programming Tools`_ packages include Infineon OpenOCD. Installing either of these packages will also install Infineon OpenOCD. If neither package is installed, a minimal installation can be done by downloading the `Infineon OpenOCD`_ release for your system and manually extract the files to a location of your choice.

.. note:: Linux requires device access rights to be set up for KitProg3. This is handled automatically by the ModusToolbox and ModusToolbox Programming Tools installations. When doing a minimal installation, this can be done manually by executing the script ``openocd/udev_rules/install_rules.sh``.

West Commands
=============

The path to the installed Infineon OpenOCD executable must be available to the ``west`` tool commands. There are multiple ways of doing this. The example below uses a permanent CMake argument to set the CMake variable ``OPENOCD``.

   .. tabs::
      .. group-tab:: Windows

         .. code-block:: shell

            # Run west config once to set permanent CMake argument
            west config build.cmake-args -- -DOPENOCD=path/to/infineon/openocd/bin/openocd.exe

            # Do a pristine build once after setting CMake argument
            west build -b cy8cproto_062_4343w -p always samples/basic/blinky

            west flash
            west debug

      .. group-tab:: Linux

         .. code-block:: shell

            # Run west config once to set permanent CMake argument
            west config build.cmake-args -- -DOPENOCD=path/to/infineon/openocd/bin/openocd

            # Do a pristine build once after setting CMake argument
            west build -b cy8cproto_062_4343w -p always samples/basic/blinky

            west flash
            west debug

Once the gdb console starts after executing the west debug command, you may now set breakpoints and perform other standard GDB debugging on the PSOC 6 CM4 core.
