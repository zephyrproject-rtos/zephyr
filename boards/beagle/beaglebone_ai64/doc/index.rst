.. zephyr:board:: beaglebone_ai64

Overview
********

BeagleBone AI-64 is a computational platform powered by TI J721E SoC, which is
targeted for automotive applications.

Hardware
********

BeagleBone AI-64 is powered by TI J721E SoC, which has three domains (MAIN,
MCU, WKUP). This document gives overview of Zephyr running on Cortex R5's
in the MAIN domain.

L1 Memory System
----------------

* 16 KB instruction cache.
* 16 KB data cache.
* 64 KB TCM.

Region Address Translation
--------------------------

The RAT module performs a region based address translation. It translates a
32-bit input address into a 48-bit output address. Any input transaction that
starts inside of a programmed region will have its address translated, if the
region is enabled.

VIM Interrupt Controller
------------------------

The VIM aggregates device interrupts and sends them to the R5F CPU(s). The VIM
module supports 512 interrupt inputs per R5F core. Each interrupt can be either
a level or a pulse (both active-high). The VIM has two interrupt outputs per core
IRQ and FIQ.

Running Zephyr
**************

The J721E does not have a separate flash for the R5 cores. Because of this
the A72 core has to load the program for the R5 cores to the right memory
address, set the PC and start the processor.
This can be done from Linux on the A72 core via remoteproc.

By default the R5's Memory Protection Unit (MPU) only allows for execution of
instructions in the ATCM/BTCM. There is also a couple regions of DRAM memory
carved out for each R5 by Linux. These can be used for IPC (DDR0) and for
data (DDR1). DDR1 can also be used for executable regions after programming
the MPU.

This is the memory mapping from A72 to the memory usable by the R5. Note that
the R5 cores always see their local ATCM at address 0x00000000 and their BTCM
at address 0x41010000. The ATCM/BTCM locations are fixed in hardware, but the
DDR regions are by convention. If you would like to use different DRAM
locations or sizes, you must also update for the same on the A72 software.
(For Linux as the A72 host, this would be changed in Device Tree).

Steps to build and run an image
-------------------------------

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application
targeting one of the Cortex R5F on BeagleBone AI-64:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: beaglebone_ai64/j721e/main_r5f0_0
   :goals: build

To load the image:

| Copy Zephyr image to the /lib/firmware/ directory.
| ``cp build/zephyr/zephyr.elf /lib/firmware/``
|
| Ensure the core is not running.
| ``echo stop > /dev/remoteproc/j7-main-r5f0_0/state``
|
| Configuring the image name to the remoteproc module.
| ``echo zephyr.elf > /dev/remoteproc/j7-main-r5f0_0/firmware``
|
| Once the image name is configured, send the start command.
| ``echo start > /dev/remoteproc/j7-main-r5f0_0/state``

Console
-------

Zephyr on BeagleBone AI-64 J721E Cortex R5 uses UART 2 (Rx p8.22, Tx p8.34)
as console.
