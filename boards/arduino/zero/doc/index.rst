The default configuration can be found in the Kconfig
:zephyr_file:`boards/arduino/zero/arduino_zero_defconfig`.

Connections and IOs
===================

The `Arduino store`_ has detailed information about board
connections. Download the `Arduino Zero Schematic`_ for more detail.

System Clock
============

The SAMD21 MCU is configured to use the 32.768 kHz external oscillator
with the on-chip PLL generating the 48 MHz system clock.  The internal
APB and GCLK unit are set up in the same way as the upstream Arduino
libraries.

Serial Port
===========

The SAMD21 MCU has 6 SERCOM based USARTs. One of the USARTs
(SERCOM5) is connected to the onboard Atmel Embedded Debugger (EDBG).
SERCOM0 is available on the D0/D1 pins.

PWM
===

The SAMD21 MCU has 3 TCC based PWM units with up to 4 outputs each and a period
of 24 bits or 16 bits.  If :code:`CONFIG_PWM_SAM0_TCC` is enabled then LED0 is
driven by TCC2 instead of by GPIO.

SPI Port
========

The SAMD21 MCU has 6 SERCOM based SPIs.  On the Arduino Zero, SERCOM4
is available on the 6 pin connector at the edge of the board.

USB Device Port
===============

The SAMD21 MCU has a USB device port that can be used to communicate
with a host PC.  See the :ref:`usb-samples` sample applications for
more, such as the :zephyr:code-sample:`usb-cdc-acm` sample which sets up a virtual
serial port that echos characters back to the host PC.

DAC
===

The SAMD21 MCU has a single channel DAC with 10 bits of resolution. On the
Arduino Zero, the DAC is available on pin A0.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

The Arduino Zero comes with a Atmel Embedded Debugger (EDBG).  This
provides a debug interface to the SAMD21 chip and is supported by
OpenOCD.

Flashing
========

#. Build the Zephyr kernel and the :ref:`hello_world` sample application:

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
      :board: arduino_zero
      :goals: build
      :compact:

#. Connect the Arduino Zero to your host computer using the USB debug
   port.

#. Run your favorite terminal program to listen for output. Under Linux the
   terminal should be :code:`/dev/ttyACM0`. For example:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0 -o

   The -o option tells minicom not to send the modem initialization
   string. Connection should be configured as follows:

   - Speed: 115200
   - Data: 8 bits
   - Parity: None
   - Stop bits: 1

#. To flash an image:

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
      :board: arduino_zero
      :goals: flash
      :compact:

   You should see "Hello World! arduino_zero" in your terminal.
