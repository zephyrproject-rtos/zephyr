Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``decawave_dwm3001cdk`` board target can be built, flashed,
and debugged in the usual way. See :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details on building and running.

Flashing
========

Follow the instructions in the :ref:`nordic_segger` page to install
and configure all the necessary software. Further information can be
found in :ref:`nordic_segger_flashing`. Then build and flash
applications as usual (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

Connect to the bottom micro-USB port labeled as J-Link and run your favorite
terminal program to listen for console output.

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D <tty_device> -b 115200

Replace :code:`<tty_device>` with the port where the DWM3001CDK board can be
found. For example, under Linux, :code:`/dev/ttyACM0`.

Then build and flash the application in the usual way.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: decawave_dwm3001cdk
   :goals: build flash
