Overview
********

`Seeed Studio XIAO nRF54L15`_ is a compact, high-performance development board featuring the cutting-edge
Nordic nRF54L15 chip. This next-generation SoC integrates an ultra-low power multiprotocol 2.4 GHz
radio and an MCU with a 128 MHz Arm® Cortex®-M33 processor and an Arm® Cortex®-M0+ for advanced
power management. It offers scalable memory up to 1.5 MB NVM and 256 KB RAM.
Designed for exceptional ultra-low power consumption, it significantly extends battery life.
Its robust radio supports Bluetooth® 6.0 (including Channel Sounding), Matter, Thread, Zigbee,
and a high-throughput 2.4 GHz proprietary mode (up to 4 Mbps).

The board includes a comprehensive set of peripherals, an integrated 128 MHz RISC-V coprocessor,
and advanced security features like TrustZone® isolation and cryptographic engine protection.
With built-in lithium battery management, XIAO nRF54L15 is ideal for compact, secure,
and energy-efficient IoT solutions such as smart wearables, industrial sensors, and advanced human-machine interfaces.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

.. zephyr:board-supported-runners::

The XIAO nRF54L15 contains a SAMD11 with CMSIS-DAP, allowing flashing, debugging, logging, etc. over
the USB port.

Flashing
========

Connect the XIAO nRF54L15 board to your host computer using the USB port. A USB CDC ACM serial port
should appear on the host, that can be used to view logs from the flashed application.

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: xiao_nrf54l15
   :goals: flash

Open a serial terminal (minicom, putty, etc.) connecting to the UCB CDC ACM serial port.

Reset the board and you should see the following message in the terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! xiao_nrf54l15
