Power Rails
-----------

The board has multiple power rails, which are always turned on in the default
configuration.

| Name    | Derived from      | Controlled by     |
+=========+===================+===================+
| MAIN    | battery, USB, ... | Always on         |

System Clock
------------

LoRa-E5 Development board System Clock could be driven by the low-power
internal(MSI), High-speed internal(HSI) or High-speed external(HSE) oscillator,
as well as main PLL clock.
By default System clock is driven by the MSI clock at 48MHz.


Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``lora_e5_dev_board`` board configuration can be built the
usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application`).

In the factory the module is flashed with an DFU bootloader, an AT command
firmware, and the read protection level 1 is enabled.
So before you can program a zephyr application to the module for the first time
you have to reset the read protection to level 0.
In case you use an st-link debugger you can use the STM32CubeProgrammer GUI to
set the RDP option byte to ``AA``,
or use the STM32_Programmer_CLI passing the ``--readunprotect`` command
to perform this read protection regression.
The RDP level 1 to RDP level 0 regression will erase the factory programmed AT
firmware, from which seeed studio has neither released the source code nor a binary.
Also, note that on the module the ``BOOT0`` pin of the SOC is not accessible,
so the system bootloader will only be executed if configured in the option bytes.

Flashing
========

The LoRa-E5 Dev Board does not include a on-board debug probe.
But the module can be debugged by connecting an external debug probe to the
blue 2.54mm header labeled ``SWIM/SWD``.
Depending on the external probe used, ``openocd``, the ``stm32cubeprogrammer``,
``pyocd``, ``blackmagic``, or ``jlink`` runner can be used to flash the board.
Additional notes:

- Pyocd: For STM32WL support Pyocd needs additional target information, which
  can be installed by adding "pack" support with the following pyocd command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pyocd pack --update
   $ pyocd pack --install stm32wl

Flashing an application to LoRa-E5 Dev board
--------------------------------------------

Connect the LoRa-E5 to your host computer using the external debug probe.
Then build and flash an application. Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

Run a serial host program to connect with your board:
Per default the console on ``usart1`` is available on the USB Type C connector
via the built-in USB to UART converter.

.. code-block:: console

   $ picocom --baud 115200 /dev/ttyACM0

Then build and flash the application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: lora_e5_dev_board
   :goals: build flash

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: lora_e5_dev_board
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
