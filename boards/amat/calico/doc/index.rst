Programming and Debugging
=========================

Flashing an application
-----------------------

Connect your device to your host computer using the JLINK USB port.
The sample application :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` is used for this example.
Build the Zephyr kernel and application, then flash it to the device:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: apollo4p_evb
   :goals: flash

.. note::
   ``west flash`` requires `SEGGER J-Link software`_ and `pylink`_ Python module
   to be installed on you host computer.

Open a serial terminal (minicom, putty, etc.) with the following settings:

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1

Reset the board and you should be able to see on the corresponding Serial Port
the following message:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! apollo4p_evb
