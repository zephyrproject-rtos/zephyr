Serial Port
===========

The AT-START-F405 board has one serial communication port. The default port
is USART1 with TX connected at PA9 and RX at PA10.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

.. zephyr:board-supported-runners::

Using ATLink or J-Link
=======================
The board comes with an embedded AT-Link programmer.
You need to install CMSIS-Pack which is required by pyOCD
when programming or debugging by the AT-Link programmer.
Execute the following command to install CMSIS-Pack for AT32F405CCT7
if not installed yet.

   .. code-block:: console

      pyocd pack install at32f405cct7

Also, J-Link can be used to program the board via the SWD interface
(PA13/SWDIO and PA14/SWCLK).

#. Build the Zephyr kernel and the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` sample application:

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
      :board: at_start_f405
      :goals: build
      :compact:

#. To flash an image:

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
      :board: at_start_f405
      :goals: flash
      :compact:

   When using J-Link, append ``--runner jlink`` option after ``west flash``.

   You should see blink LED2 on board AT-START-F405.

#. To debug an image:

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
      :board: at_start_f405
      :goals: debug
      :compact:

   When using J-Link, append ``--runner jlink`` option after ``west debug``.
