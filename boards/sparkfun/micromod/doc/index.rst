#################################

Overview
********

MicroMod is a solderless, modular interface ecosystem that uses the M.2 standard
to mix and match your choice of processor with specific Function Boards or
stand-alone Carrier Boards. A MicroMod processor board is approximately 22x22 mm,
and can insert into any MicroMod carrier board. More information can be found in
the `Micromod specification website`_.

All Micromod board targets support the following hardware features:

- USB host mode compliant to 2.0 specification
- GPIO
- 2 UART
- 2 I2C
- 2 SPI
- 2 ADC
- 2 PWM
- Watchdog Timer (WDT)

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``micromod/nrf52840`` board target can be
built, flashed, and debugged in the usual way. See
:ref:`build_an_application` and :ref:`application_run` for more details on
building and running.

Flashing
========

Follow the instructions in the :ref:`nordic_segger` page to install
and configure all the necessary software. Further information can be
found in :ref:`nordic_segger_flashing`. Then build and flash
applications as usual (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

The flashing tool will depend on the carrier used along with the board.
In the case of `Sparkfun asset tracking carrier`, it is possible to use
the SWD interface along with a J-Link.

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

First, run your favorite terminal program to listen for output.

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D <tty_device> -b 115200

Replace :code:`<tty_device>` with the port where the board nRF52840 DK
can be found. For example, under Linux, :code:`/dev/ttyACM0`.

Then build and flash the application in the usual way.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: micromod/nrf52840
   :goals: build flash

Debugging
=========

Refer to the :ref:`nordic_segger` page to learn about debugging Nordic boards with a
Segger IC.

In case of using a Nordic Segger Jlink, it is possible to configure the app to use Segger Real
Time Transfer (RTT) for debugging. In this case, build your app with the
:ref:`RTT snippet <snippet-rtt-console>`.

Testing the on-board LED
************************

There is a sample that allow you to test the LED on the board is working properly
with Zephyr:

* :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky`

You can build and flash the example to make sure Zephyr is running correctly on
your board. The button and LED definitions can be found in
:zephyr_file:`boards/sparkfun/micromod/micromod_nrf52840.dts`.

Testing the 128Mb qspi memory flash
***********************************

The ``micromod/nrf52840`` board target has a built-in NOR flash memory connected
to the qspi interface. It can be tested with the samples/drivers/jesd216 app.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/drivers/jesd216
   :board: micromod/nrf52840
   :goals: build flash
