nRF52-VBLUno52
##############

Overview
********

Zephyr can use the nrf52_vbluno52 board configuration to run on the VBLUno52 board,
a VNG Bluetooth Low Energy UNO using an nRF52832 ARM Cortex-M4F processor.
It provides support for the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52832 ARM Cortex-M4F CPU and
the following devices:

* :abbr:`NVIC (Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller)`
* :abbr:`RTC (nRF RTC System Clock)`
* UART
* GPIO
* FLASH
* RADIO (Bluetooth Low Energy 5.0)

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Flashing
========

The VBLUno52 board has an on-board DAPLink (CMSIS-DAP) interface for flashing and debugging.
You do not need any other programming device.
You only need to install the pyOCD tool (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyOCD)

See the :ref:`getting_started` for general information on setting up
your development environment.

You can build and flash applications in the usual way. Here is an
example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nrf52_vbluno52
   :goals: build flash

Testing the VBLUno52 with Zephyr: buttons, LEDs, UART, BLE
**********************************************************

Here are some sample applications that you can use to test different
components on the VBLUno52 board:

* :ref:`hello_world`
* :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky`
* :zephyr:code-sample:`button`
* :ref:`bluetooth-beacon-sample`
* :ref:`peripheral_hr`
