System Clock
============

The STM32F072CB PLL is driven by an external crystal oscillator (HSE) running at 8 MHz and
configured to provide a system clock of 48 MHz.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Build and flash applications as usual (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

If flashing via USB DFU, short pins ``B0`` and ``3V3`` when applying power to the UCAN board in
order to enter the built-in DFU mode.

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application.
