Overview
********

The Nano is a development board equipped with Nordic's nRF51822 Bluetooth Low Energy SOC.
This board is available on `RedBear Store`_.

Hardware
********

nRF51 BLE Nano has two external oscillators. The frequency of the slow clock
is 32.768 kHz. The frequency of the main clock is 16 MHz.

The DAPLink USB board acts as a dongle. DAPLink debug probes appear on the host computer as a USB disk.
It also regulates 5V from USB to 3.3V via the onboard LDO to power Nano.

More information about Nano and DAPLink can be found at the `RedBear Github`_.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``nrf51_blenano`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

To flash an application, you'll need to connect your BLE Nano with the
DAPLink board, then attach that to your computer via USB.

.. warning::

   Be careful to mount the BLE Nano correctly! The side of the board
   with the VIN and GND pins should face **towards** the USB connector.
   The `RedBear Store`_ page links to a tutorial video that shows how to
   properly solder headers and assemble the DAPLink and BLE Nano boards.

Now build and flash applications as usual. Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nrf51_blenano
   :goals: build flash

Debugging
=========

After mounting the BLE Nano on its DAPLink board as described above,
you can debug an application in the usual way. Here is an example for
the :ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nrf51_blenano
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
