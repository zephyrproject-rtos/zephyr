Redbear Labs Nano v2
####################

Overview
********

The Nano v2 is a development board equipped with Nordic's next generation nRF52832 Bluetooth Low Energy SOC.
This board was designed as a 'drop-in' replacement of BLE Nano with exactly the same form factor.

Hardware
********
- nRF52832 SoC is built around a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4F CPU with 512kB flash + 64kB RAM
- 11 x Digital I/0
- 1 UART with hardware flow control ( 4 I/O pins occupied )
- 1 I2C ( 2 I/O pins occupied )



Supported Features
==================
The BLE Nano v2 board configuration supports the following hardware features:

+-----------+------------+--------------------------------------+
| Interface | Controller |      Driver/Component                |

The DAPLink USB board acts as a dongle. DAPLink debug probes appear on the host computer as a USB disk.
It also regulates 5V from USB to 3.3V via the onboard LDO to power Nano v2.


Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``nrf52_blenano2`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

To flash an application, you'll need to connect your BLE Nano 2 with the
DAPLink board, then attach that to your computer via USB.

.. warning::

   Be careful to mount the BLE Nano 2 correctly! The side of the board
   with the VIN and GND pins should face **towards** the USB
   connector.

Now build and flash applications as usual. Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nrf52_blenano2
   :goals: build flash

Debugging
=========

After mounting the BLE Nano 2 on its DAPLink board as described above,
you can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for
the :ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nrf52_blenano2
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
