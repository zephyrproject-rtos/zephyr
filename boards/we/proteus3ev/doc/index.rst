Overview
********

The Proteus-III-EV (evaluation board) hardware provides support
for the Proteus-III radio module that uses the Nordic Semiconductor
nRF52840 ARM Cortex-M4F CPU and the following devices:

* :abbr:`ADC (Analog to Digital Converter)`
* CLOCK
* FLASH
* :abbr:`GPIO (General Purpose Input Output)`
* :abbr:`I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)`
* :abbr:`MPU (Memory Protection Unit)`
* :abbr:`NVIC (Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller)`
* :abbr:`PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)`
* RADIO (Bluetooth Low Energy and 802.15.4)
* :abbr:`RTC (nRF RTC System Clock)`
* Segger RTT (RTT Console)
* :abbr:`SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)`
* :abbr:`UART (Universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter)`
* :abbr:`WDT (Watchdog Timer)`

More information about the radio module can be found the WÃ¼rth Elektronik
web page https://www.we-online.com/katalog/de/PROTEUS-III .


Hardware
********

Proteus-III radio module provides only the internal oscillators. The
frequency of the slow clock is 32.768 kHz. The frequency of the main
clock is 32 MHz.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``we_proteus3ev/nrf52840`` board configuration can be
built, flashed, and debugged in the usual way. See
:ref:`build_an_application` and :ref:`application_run` for more details on
building and running.

Flashing
========

Follow the instructions in the :ref:`nordic_segger` page to install
and configure all the necessary software. Further information can be
found in :ref:`nordic_segger_flashing`. Then build and flash
applications as usual (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

First, run your favorite terminal program to listen for output.

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D <tty_device> -b 115200

Replace :code:`<tty_device>` with the port where the board Proteus-III-EV
can be found. For example, under Linux, :code:`/dev/ttyACM0`.

Then build and flash the application in the usual way.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: we_proteus3ev/nrf52840
   :goals: build flash

Debugging
=========

Refer to the :ref:`nordic_segger` page to learn about debugging Nordic
boards with a Segger IC.

Testing the LEDs and buttons in the Proteus-III-EV
**************************************************

There are 2 samples that allow you to test that the buttons (switches) and
LEDs on the board are working properly with Zephyr:

.. code-block:: console

   samples/basic/blinky
   samples/basic/button

You can build and flash the examples to make sure Zephyr is running correctly
on your board. The button and LED definitions can be found in
:zephyr_file:`boards/we/proteus3ev/we_proteus3ev_nrf52840.dts`.
