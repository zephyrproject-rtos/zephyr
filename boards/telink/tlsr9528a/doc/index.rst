Board supports power-down modes: suspend and deep-sleep. For deep-sleep mode only 96KB of retention memory is available.
Board supports HW cryptography acceleration (AES and ECC till 256 bits). MbedTLS interface is used as cryptography front-end.

.. note::
   To support "button" example project PD6-KEY3 (J5-13, J5-14) jumper needs to be removed and KEY3 (J5-13) should be connected to GND (J3-30) externally.

   For the rest example projects use the default jumpers configuration.

Limitations
-----------

- Maximum 3 GPIO ports could be configured to generate external interrupts simultaneously. All ports should use different IRQ numbers.
- DMA mode is not supported by I2C, SPI and Serial Port.
- SPI Slave mode is not implemented.
- I2C Slave mode is not implemented.
- Bluetooth is not compatible with deep-sleep mode. Only suspend is allowed when Bluetooth is active.
- USB working only in active mode (No power down supported).
- During deep-sleep all GPIO's are in Hi-Z mode.
- Shell is not compatible with sleep modes.

Default configuration and IOs
=============================

System Clock
------------

The TLSR9528A board is configured to use the 24 MHz external crystal oscillator
with the on-chip PLL/DIV generating the 48 MHz system clock.
The following values also could be assigned to the system clock in the board DTS file
(``boards/riscv/tlsr9528a/tlsr9528a-common.dtsi``):

- 16000000
- 24000000
- 32000000
- 48000000
- 60000000
- 96000000

.. code-block::

   &cpu0 {
       clock-frequency = <48000000>;
   };

PINs Configuration
------------------

The TLSR9528A SoC has five GPIO controllers (PORT_A to PORT_F), and the next are
currently enabled:

- LED0 (blue): PD0, LED1 (green): PD1, LED2 (white): PE6, LED3 (red): PE7
- Key Matrix SW2: PD2_PD6, SW3: PD2_PF6, SW4: PD7_PD6, SW5: PD7_PF6

Peripheral's pins on the SoC are mapped to the following GPIO pins in the
``boards/riscv/tlsr9528a/tlsr9528a-common.dtsi`` file:

- UART0 TX: PB2, RX: PB3
- UART1 TX: PC6, RX: PC7
- PWM Channel 0: PD0
- LSPI CLK: PE1, MISO: PE3, MOSI: PE2
- GSPI CLK: PA2, MISO: PA3, MOSI: PA4
- I2C SCL: PC0, SDA: PC1

Serial Port
-----------

The TLSR9528A SoC has 2 UARTs. The Zephyr console output is assigned to UART0.
The default settings are 115200 8N1.

USB COM Port (ACM) as Serial Port Configuration
-----------------------------------------------

To use the USB COM port (ACM) instead of UART, follow these steps:

1. Add the following configuration to your project:

.. code-block:: none
    CONFIG_LOG=y
    CONFIG_USB_DEVICE_STACK=y
    CONFIG_USB_DEVICE_INITIALIZE_AT_BOOT=n
    CONFIG_USB_CDC_ACM_LOG_LEVEL_OFF=y
2. Include the following overlay configuration:

.. code-block:: dts
    / {
        chosen {
            zephyr,console = &cdc_acm_uart0;
            zephyr,shell-uart = &cdc_acm_uart0;
        };
    };
    &zephyr_udc0 {
        cdc_acm_uart0: cdc_acm_uart0 {
            compatible = "zephyr,cdc-acm-uart";
        };
    };
3. Connect the USB cable to your device. A new ACM serial device should appear in your system (e.g., ``/dev/ttyACM0`` on Linux or a COM port on Windows).
4. Use your preferred terminal application (like ``minicom``, ``screen``, or ``PuTTY``) to connect to the newly detected ACM serial device.

5. In your source code, ensure the following header is included and the USB device stack is initialized:

.. code-block:: c

    #ifdef CONFIG_USB_DEVICE_STACK
    #include <zephyr/usb/usb_device.h>
    #endif
    #ifdef CONFIG_USB_DEVICE_STACK
    usb_enable(NULL);
    #endif

Programming and debugging
*************************

Building
========

.. important::

   These instructions assume you've set up a development environment as
   described in the `Zephyr Getting Started Guide`_.

To build applications using the defaultÂ RISC-V toolchain from Zephyr SDK, just run the west build command.
Here is an example for the "hello_world" application.

.. code-block:: console

   # From the root of the zephyr repository
   west build -b tlsr9528a samples/hello_world

Open a serial terminal with the following settings:

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1

Flash the board, reset and observe the following messages on the selected
serial port:

.. code-block:: console

   *** Booting Zephyr OS version 2.5.0  ***
   Hello World! tlsr9528a


Flashing
========

To flash the TLSR9528A board see the sources below:

- `Burning and Debugging Tools for all Series`_

It is also possible to use the west flash command. Download BDT tool for Linux `Burning and Debugging Tool for Linux`_ or
`Burning and Debugging Tool for Windows`_ and extract archive into some directory you wish TELINK_BDT_BASE_DIR

- Now you should be able to run the west flash command with the BDT path specified (TELINK_BDT_BASE_DIR).

.. code-block:: console

   west flash --bdt-path=$TELINK_BDT_BASE_DIR --erase

- You can also run the west flash command without BDT path specification if TELINK_BDT_BASE_DIR is in your environment (.bashrc).

.. code-block:: console

   export TELINK_BDT_BASE_DIR="/opt/telink_bdt/"
