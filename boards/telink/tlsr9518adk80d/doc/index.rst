.. note::
   To support "button" example project PC3-KEY3 (J20-19, J20-20) jumper needs to be removed and KEY3 (J20-19) should be connected to VDD3_DCDC (J51-13) externally.

   For the rest example projects use the default jumpers configuration.

Other hardware features and example projects are not supported yet.

Limitations
-----------

- Maximum 3 GPIO pins could be configured to generate interrupts simultaneously. All pins must be related to different ports and use different IRQ numbers.
- DMA mode is not supported by I2C, SPI and Serial Port.
- UART hardware flow control is not implemented.
- SPI Slave mode is not implemented.
- I2C Slave mode is not implemented.

Default configuration and IOs
=============================

System Clock
------------

The TLSR9518ADK80D board is configured to use the 24 MHz external crystal oscillator
with the on-chip PLL/DIV generating the 48 MHz system clock.
The following values also could be assigned to the system clock in the board DTS file
:zephyr_file:`boards/telink/tlsr9518adk80d/tlsr9518adk80d.dts`:

- 16000000
- 24000000
- 32000000
- 48000000
- 64000000
- 96000000

.. code-block::

   &cpu0 {
       clock-frequency = <48000000>;
   };

PINs Configuration
------------------

The TLSR9518A SoC has five GPIO controllers (PORT_A to PORT_E), but only two are
currently enabled (PORT_B for LEDs control and PORT_C for buttons) in the board DTS file:

- LED0 (blue): PB4, LED1 (green): PB5, LED2 (white): PB6, LED3 (red): PB7
- Key Matrix SW0: PC2_PC3, SW1: PC2_PC1, SW2: PC0_PC3, SW3: PC0_PC1

Peripheral's pins on the SoC are mapped to the following GPIO pins in the
:zephyr_file:`boards/telink/tlsr9518adk80d/tlsr9518adk80d.dts` file:

- UART0 TX: PB2, RX: PB3
- UART1 TX: PC6, RX: PC7
- PWM Channel 0: PB4
- PSPI CS0: PC4, CLK: PC5, MISO: PC6, MOSI: PC7
- HSPI CS0: PA1, CLK: PA2, MISO: PA3, MOSI: PA4
- I2C SCL: PE1, SDA: PE3

Serial Port
-----------

The TLSR9518A SoC has 2 UARTs. The Zephyr console output is assigned to UART0.
The default settings are 115200 8N1.

Programming and debugging
*************************

Building
========

.. important::

   These instructions assume you've set up a development environment as
   described in the :ref:`getting_started`.

To build applications using the defaultÂ RISC-V toolchain from Zephyr SDK, just run the west build command.
Here is an example for the "hello_world" application.

.. code-block:: console

   # From the root of the zephyr repository
   west build -b tlsr9518adk80d samples/hello_world

To use `Telink RISC-V Linux Toolchain`_, ``ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT`` and ``CROSS_COMPILE`` variables need to be set.
In addition ``CONFIG_FPU=y`` must be selected in :zephyr_file:`boards/telink/tlsr9518adk80d/tlsr9518adk80d_defconfig` file since this
toolchain is compatible only with the float point unit usage.

.. code-block:: console

   # Set Zephyr toolchain variant to cross-compile
   export ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT=cross-compile
   # Specify the Telink RISC-V Toolchain location
   export CROSS_COMPILE=~/toolchains/nds32le-elf-mculib-v5f/bin/riscv32-elf-
   # From the root of the zephyr repository
   west build -b tlsr9518adk80d samples/hello_world

`Telink RISC-V Linux Toolchain`_ is available on the `Burning and Debugging Tools for TLSR9 Series in Linux`_ page.

Open a serial terminal with the following settings:

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1

Flash the board, reset and observe the following messages on the selected
serial port:

.. code-block:: console

   *** Booting Zephyr OS version 2.5.0  ***
   Hello World! tlsr9518adk80d


Flashing
========

To flash the TLSR9518ADK80D board see the sources below:

- `Burning and Debugging Tools for all Series`_
- `Burning and Debugging Tools for TLSR9 Series`_
- `Burning and Debugging Tools for TLSR9 Series in Linux`_

It is also possible to use the west flash command, but additional steps are required to set it up:

- Download `Telink RISC-V Linux Toolchain`_. The toolchain contains tools for the board flashing as well.
- Since the ICEman tool is created for the 32-bit OS version it is necessary to install additional packages in case of the 64-bit OS version.

.. code-block:: console

   sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386

-  Run the "ICEman.sh" script.

.. code-block:: console

   # From the root of the {path to the Telink RISC-V Linux Toolchain}/ice repository
   sudo ./ICEman.sh

- Now you should be able to run the west flash command with the toolchain path specified (TELINK_TOOLCHAIN_PATH).

.. code-block:: console

   west flash --telink-tools-path=$TELINK_TOOLCHAIN_PATH

- You can also run the west flash command without toolchain path specification if add SPI_burn and ICEman to PATH.

.. code-block:: console

    export PATH=$TELINK_TOOLCHAIN_PATH/flash/bin:"$PATH"
    export PATH=$TELINK_TOOLCHAIN_PATH/ice:"$PATH"

Debugging
=========

This port supports UART debug and OpenOCD+GDB. The `west debug` command also supported. You may run
it in a simple way, like:

.. code-block:: console

   west debug

Or with additional arguments, like:

.. code-block:: console

   west debug --gdb-port=<port_number> --gdb-ex=<additional_ex_arguments>

Example:

.. code-block:: console

   west debug --gdb-port=1111 --gdb-ex="-ex monitor reset halt -ex b main -ex continue"
