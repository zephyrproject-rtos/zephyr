Overview
********

The SAMA7G54-EK evaluation kit is intended for evaluating and prototyping with
the SAMA7G54 microprocessor (MPU). The SAMA7G54 is a Arm Cortex-A7 based MPU
running up to 1GHz supporting up to 2GBytes of 16-bit DDR2, DDR3, DDR3L, LPDDR2,
LPDDR3, with octal/quad SPI, NAND and e.MMC Flash support.

The SAMA7G54 integrates a complete imaging and audio subsystems with 12-bit
parallel and MIPI-CSI2 camera interfaces up to 8 Mp and 720p @ 60 fps, up to
four I2S, one SPDIF transmitter and receiver and a 4-stereo channel audio sample
rate converter. The device also features a large number of connectivity options
including Dual Ethernet (one Gigabit ethernet and one 10/100 Ethernet), six
CAN-FD and three high-speed USB and offers advanced security functions such as:
secure boot, secure key storage, high-performance crypto accelerators for AES,
SHA, RSA and ECC.

The SAMA7G54-EK board itself features connectors and expansion headers for easy
customization and quick access to leading edge embedded features such as MIKROE
Click boards™ and Raspberry Pi expansion header plus MIPI CSI camera.
