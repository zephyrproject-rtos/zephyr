Overview
********

The EV63J76A (SAMA7D65 Curiosity Kit) is a development kit for evaluating and
prototyping with Microchip SAMA7D65 microprocessor (MPU). The SAMA7D65 MPU is a
high-performance ARM Cortex-A7 CPU-based embedded MPU running up to 1GHz.

The board allows evaluation of powerful peripherals for connectivity, audio and
user interface applications, including MIPI-DSI and LVDS w/ 2D graphics, dual
Gigabit Ethernet w/ TSN and CAN-FD.  The MPUs offer advanced security functions,
like tamper detection, secure boot, secure key stoarge, TRNG, PUF as well as
higher-performance crypto accelerators for AES and SHA.

The SAMA7D65 series is supported by Microchip MPLAB-X development tools, Harmony
V3, Linux distributions and Microchip Graphic Suite (MGS) for Linux. The
SAMA7D65 is well-suited for industrial and automotive applications with
graphical displays support up to WXGA/720p.
