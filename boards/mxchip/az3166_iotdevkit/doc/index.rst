Overview
********

The AZ3166 IoT DevKit from MXChip is a development board designed for IoT (Internet of Things)
projects. It's an all-in-one board powered by an Arm Cortex-M4 processor. On-board peripherals
include an OLED screen, headphone output, stereo microphone and abundant sensors like humidity &
temperature, pressure, motion (accelerometer & gyroscope) and magnetometer.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Flashing
========

Build and flash applications as usual (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

First, run your favorite terminal program to listen for output.

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D <tty_device> -b 115200

Replace :code:`<tty_device>` with the port where the micro:bit board
can be found. For example, under Linux, :code:`/dev/ttyACM0`.

Then build and flash the application in the usual way.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: az3166_iotdevkit
   :goals: build flash
