.. zephyr:board:: yd_stm32h750vb

Overview
********

The YD-STM32H750VB development board is a complete demonstration and development
platform for Arm |reg| Cortex |reg|-M7 core-based STM32H750VBT6 microcontroller, with
128Kbytes of Flash memory and 1 Mbytes of SRAM.

More information about STM32H750 can be found here:

- `STM32H750xx datasheet`_

Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

Pin Mapping
===========

Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------

- UART_1_TX : PA9
- UART_1_RX : PA10
- LED_1 : PA13 (SWDIO)
- LED_2 : PA14 (SWCLK)
- LED_3 : PA15
- LED_4 : PB4
- KEY : PB3

System Clock
============

The STM32H750VB System Clock can be driven by an internal or external oscillator,
as well as by the main PLL clock. By default, the System clock
is driven by the PLL clock at 480MHz. PLL clock is feed by a 25MHz high speed external clock.

Flashing
========

There are 2 main entry points for flashing STM32H750VB SoCs, one using the ROM
bootloader, and another by using the SWD debug port (which requires additional
hardware such as ST-Link). Flashing using the ROM bootloader requires a special activation
pattern, which can be triggered by using the BOOT0 button.

Installing dfu-util
-------------------

It is recommended to use at least v0.8 of `dfu-util`_. The package available in
debian/ubuntu can be quite old, so you might have to build dfu-util from source.

There is also a Windows version which works, but you may have to install the
right USB drivers with a tool like `Zadig`_.

Flashing an application to YD-STM32H750VB
-----------------------------------------

Connect a USB-C cable and the board should power ON. Force the board into DFU mode
by keeping the BOOT0 switch pressed while pressing and releasing the RST switch.

The dfu-util runner is supported on this board and so a sample can be built and
tested easily.

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: yd_stm32h750vb
   :goals: build flash

You will see the LED blinking every second.

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: yd_stm32h750vb
   :goals: debug
