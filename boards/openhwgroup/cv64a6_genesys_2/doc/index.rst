.. zephyr:board:: cv64a6_genesys_2

Overview
********

The Digilent Genesys 2 board features a Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA which can run various softcore CPUs.
In this configuration, the Genesys 2 is configured with a 64-bit version of the CVA6 RISC-V CPU.
The SoC is configured with a memory controller interfacing with the Genesys' DRAM, PLIC and CLINT
interrupt controllers, a UART device interfacing with the Genesys' USB UART, a RISC-V compatible
debug module that interfaces with the Genesys' FTDI (USB JTAG) chip, a Xilinx SPI interface
interfacing with the Genesys' SD card slot and a Xilinx GPIO interfacing with the Genesys' LEDs
and switches.
The complete hardware sources (see first reference) in conjunction with
instructions for compiling and loading the configuration onto the Genesys 2 are available.

Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Loading the FPGA configuration
==============================

You need to build a bitstream with Xilinx Vivado and load it into the FPGA
before you can load zephyr onto the board.
Please refer to the CVA6 documentation for the required steps.
This configuration is compatible with the following build target: cv64a6_imafdc_sv39

Flashing
========
west flash is supported via the openocd runner.
Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: cv64a6_genesys_2
   :goals: build flash

Debugging
=========

west debug, attach and debugserver commands are supported via the openocd runner.
Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: cv64a6_genesys_2
   :goals: build debug
