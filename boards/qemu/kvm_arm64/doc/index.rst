ARM AArch64 Virt KVM Emulation (QEMU)
#####################################

Overview
********

This board configuration will use QEMU to run a KVM guest on an AArch64
host.

This configuration provides support for an AArch64 Cortex-A CPU and these
devices:

* GICv3 interrupt controller
* ARM architected timer
* PL011 UART controller

Hardware
********
