ARM Cortex-M0 Emulation (QEMU)
##############################

Overview
********

This board configuration will use QEMU to emulate the
BBC Microbit (Nordic nRF51822) platform.

This configuration provides support for an ARM Cortex-M0 CPU and these devices:

* Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller
* TIMER (nRF TIMER System Clock)

.. note::
   This board configuration makes no claims about its suitability for use
   with an actual nRF51 Microbit hardware system, or any other hardware system.

Hardware
********
Supported Features
==================

The following hardware features are supported:

+--------------+------------+----------------------+
| Interface    | Controller | Driver/Component     |
+==============+============+======================+
| NVIC         | on-chip    | nested vectored      |
|              |            | interrupt controller |
+--------------+------------+----------------------+
| nRF          | on-chip    | serial port          |
| UART         |            |                      |
+--------------+------------+----------------------+
| nRF TIMER    | on-chip    | system clock         |
+--------------+------------+----------------------+

The kernel currently does not support other hardware features on this platform.

Devices
========
System Clock
------------

This board configuration uses a system clock frequency of 1 MHz.

Serial Port
-----------

This board configuration uses a single serial communication channel with the
CPU's UART0.

Known Problems or Limitations
==============================

The following platform features are unsupported:

* Writing to the hardware's flash memory


Programming and Debugging
*************************

Use this configuration to run basic Zephyr applications and kernel tests in the QEMU
emulated environment, for example, with the :zephyr:code-sample:`synchronization` sample:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/synchronization
   :host-os: unix
   :board: qemu_cortex_m0
   :goals: run

This will build an image with the synchronization sample app, boot it using
QEMU, and display the following console output:

.. code-block:: console
