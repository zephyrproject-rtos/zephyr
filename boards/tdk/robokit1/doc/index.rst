.. zephyr:board:: robokit1

Overview
********

The TDK RoboKit1 is a development board for use primarily with ROS2 and provides a large
number of small ground robotics useful sensors including chirp sensors for time of flight
(e.g. ultrasonic obstacle detection).

It pairs a 300MHz Cortex-M7 ATSAME70Q21 with an array of TDK sensors and pin headers useful for robotics.

Connections and IOs
===================

The TDK RoboKit Hardware Guide has detailed information about board connections.

System Clock
============

The SAM E70 MCU is configured to use the 12 MHz external oscillator on the board
with the on-chip PLL to generate a 300 MHz system clock.

Serial Port
===========

The ATSAME70Q21 MCU has five UARTs and three USARTs. One of the UARTs is
configured for the console and is available as a Virtual COM Port via the USB2 connector.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Flashing the Zephyr project onto SAM E70 MCU requires the `OpenOCD tool`_.
Both west flash and west debug commands should correctly work with both USB0 and USB1
connected and the board powered.

Flashing
========

#. Run your favorite terminal program to listen for output. Under Linux the
   terminal should be :code:`/dev/ttyACM0`. For example:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -o

   The -o option tells minicom not to send the modem initialization
   string. Connection should be configured as follows:

   - Speed: 115200
   - Data: 8 bits
   - Parity: None
   - Stop bits: 1

#. Connect the TDK RoboKit1 board to your host computer using the
   USB debug port (USB1), USB2 for a serial console, and remaining micro USB for
   power. Then build and flash the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
      :board: robokit1
      :goals: build flash

   You should see "Hello World! robokit1" in your terminal.

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: robokit1
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
