.. zephyr:board:: ch32v003f4p6_dev_board

Overview
********

The `WCH`_ CH32V003F4P6 Development Board hardware provides support for
QingKe 32-bit RISC-V2A processor and the following devices:

* CLOCK
* :abbr:`GPIO (General Purpose Input Output)`
* :abbr:`NVIC (Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller)`

The board is equipped with one LED, wired to PD1 and SWIO pins.
The `WCH webpage on CH32V003`_ contains the processor's information
and the datasheet.

Hardware
********

The QingKe 32-bit RISC-V2A processor of the WCH CH32V003F4P6_DEV_BOARD is clocked
by an internal RC oscillator and runs at 24 MHz.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``ch32v003f4p6_dev_board`` board target can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and :ref:`application_run`
for more details); however, an external programmer is required since the board
does not have any built-in debug support.

The following pins of the external programmer must be connected to the
following pins on the PCB (see image):

* VCC = VCC (do not power the board from the USB port at the same time)
* GND = GND
* SWIO = PD1

Flashing
========

SWIO pin is connected to PD1 and also to led on the board. By default, the function
of PD1 is SWD. To use the led on the board, the function of PD1 is changed to GPIO
if PD1 is not put to ground (see :zephyr_file:`boards/wch/ch32v003f4p6_dev_board/board.c`).
In order to be able to reflash the board, if some zephyr application is already loaded
in flash, power on the board with PD1 put to ground to let PD1 as SWIO. After that,
reconnect the external debugger SWDIO pin to PD1/SWIO to be able to flash the board
using the external debugger.

You can use ``minichlink`` to flash the board. Once ``minichlink`` has been set
up, build and flash applications as usual (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: ch32v003f4p6_dev_board
   :goals: build flash

Debugging
=========

This board can be debugged via OpenOCD or ``minichlink``.

Testing the LED on the WCH CH32V003F4P6_DEV_BOARD
*************************************************

There is 1 sample program that allow you to test that the LED on the board is
working properly with Zephyr:

.. code-block:: console

   samples/basic/blinky

You can build and flash the examples to make sure Zephyr is running
correctly on your board. The button and LED definition can be found
in :zephyr_file:`boards/wch/ch32v003f4p6_dev_board/ch32v003f4p6_dev_board.dts`.
