`Corstone-300 FVP`_/`Corstone-310 FVP`_ (Fixed Virtual Platforms) is a complete
simulations of the Arm system, including processor, memory and peripherals.
They are available free of charge for Linux and Windows systems.
The FVPs have been selected for simulation since they provide access to the
Ethos-U55 NPU, which is unavailable in QEMU or other simulation platforms.

Supported Features
===================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

Serial Port
===========

The MPS3 has six UARTs. The Zephyr console output by default, uses
UART0, which is exposed over the Debug USB interface (J8).

Serial port 0 on the Debug USB interface is the MCC board control console.

Serial port 1 on the Debug USB interface is connected to UART 0.

Serial port 2 on the Debug USB interface is connected to UART 1.

Serial port 3 on the Debug USB interface is connected to UART 2.

.. Programming and Debugging:

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Flashing
========

MPS3 provides:

- A USB connection to the host computer, which exposes Mass Storage and
  CMSIS-DAP, and serial ports.

Building an application with AN547
----------------------------------

You can build applications in the usual way. Here is an example for
the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application with AN547.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: mps3/corstone300/an547
   :goals: build

Open a serial terminal (minicom, putty, etc.) with the following settings:

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1

Reset the board, and you should see the following message on the corresponding
serial port:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! mps3

Uploading an application to MPS3 AN547
---------------------------------------

Applications can be in elf, hex or bin format. The binaries are flashed when
the board boots up, using files stored on the on-board Micro SD card. The
Motherboard Configuration Controller (MCC) is responsible for loading the FPGA
image and binaries.

Connect the MPS3 to your host computer using the USB port. You should see a
USB connection exposing a Mass Storage (``V2M-MPS3`` by default).

The update requires 3 steps:

1. Copy application files to ``<MPS3 device name>/SOFTWARE/``.
2. Open ``<MPS3 device name>/MB/HBI0309C/AN547/images.txt``.
3. Update the ``images.txt`` file as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   TITLE: Versatile Express Images Configuration File

   [IMAGES]
   TOTALIMAGES: 1 ;Number of Images (Max: 32)

   IMAGE0ADDRESS: 0x01000000 ;Please select the required executable program

   IMAGE0FILE: \SOFTWARE\zephyr.elf


Reset the board, and you should see the following message on the corresponding
serial port:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! mps3
