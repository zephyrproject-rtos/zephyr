	  When selected the execution of the process will be slowed down to real time.
	  (if there is a lot of load it may be slower than real time)
	  If deselected, the process will run as fast as possible.
	  Note that this only decouples simulated time from real/wall time. In either
	  case the zephyr kernel and application cannot tell the difference unless they
	  interact with some other driver/device which runs at real time.

	  When selected the bs_radio peripheral will be enabled and compiled
	  against BabbleSim lib2G4PhyComv1 library.
