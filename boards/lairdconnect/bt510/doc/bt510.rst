* MAG = P1.14

Accelerometer
-------------

The BT510 incorporates an I2C ST Microelectronics LIS2DH accelerometer. Refer to the `ST Microelectronics LIS2DH datasheet`_ for further details.

* SDA = P0.26
* SCL = P0.27
* INT_1 = P1.05
* INT_2 = P1.12

Temperature Sensor
------------------

The BT510 incorporates an I2C Silabs SI7055 temperature sensor. Refer to the `Silabs 7055 datasheet`_ for further details.

* SDA = P0.26
* SCL = P0.27

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``bt510`` board configuration can be built, flashed, and
debugged in the usual way. See :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details on building and running.

The BT510 features a TagConnect 10 way socket for connection of a
programmer/debugger, refer to `TagConnect TC2050 product page`_
for details of an appropriate TagConnect cable.

A non-standard layout is used to include access to the sensor debug UART.

+-----------+------------+----------------------+
| Pin No.   | Name       | Description          |
+===========+============+======================+
| 1         | Vcc        | Power Supply, 3.3V   |
+-----------+------------+----------------------+
| 2         | SWDIO      | SWD Data             |
+-----------+------------+----------------------+
| 3         | RXD        | Debug UART RX Data   |
+-----------+------------+----------------------+
| 4         | SWDCLK     | SWD Clock            |
+-----------+------------+----------------------+
| 5         | TM         | Spare GPIO           |
+-----------+------------+----------------------+
| 6         | SWO        | SWD Output           |
+-----------+------------+----------------------+
| 7         | N/C        | Not Connected        |
+-----------+------------+----------------------+
| 8         | TXD        | Debug UART TX Data   |
+-----------+------------+----------------------+
| 9         | GND        | Ground               |
+-----------+------------+----------------------+
| 10        | RESET      | Reset, Active Low    |
+-----------+------------+----------------------+

Connectivity to the programmer/debugger must be modified to match
the pinout shown above.

Laird Connectivity provide the USB-SWD programming board (750-03239) that supports
this connector layout, refer to the `USB SWD Programmer product page`_
.

Flashing
========

To connect the BT510 board for programming or debugging using the USB-SWD programming
board, on the programming board set SW6 to the supply out position and SW5 to the 3V3
position, ensure there is a jumper on J35 and that SW1 is in the debug position, then
connect the BT510 to the board using the Tag-Connect cable via J3:

.. figure:: img/bt510_prog.jpg
     :align: center
     :alt: Sentrius BT510 Sensor connected to programming board

Then build and flash applications as usual (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details). For example, to flash:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ninja flash

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

First, run your favorite terminal program to listen for output.

NOTE: On the BT510, the UART lines are at TTL levels and must be passed through
an appropriate line driver circuit for translation to RS232 levels. Refer to the `MAX3232 datasheet`_
for a suitable driver IC. The USB-SWD programming board has an in-built UART connected
to the BT510 acting as a USB CDC port, on Linux and Windows 10 this driver should be
installed automatically, for Windows 7, the MBED driver is required to use the serial
port - see the `MBED Serial Driver`_ link for details and how to install the driver.

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D <tty_device> -b 115200

Replace :code:`<tty_device>` with the port where the bt510 can be found. For example, under Linux, :code:`/dev/ttyACM0`.

Then build and flash the application in the usual way.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: bt510
   :goals: build flash

Note that an external debugger is required to perform application flashing.

Debugging
=========

The ``bt510`` board does not have an on-board J-Link debug IC
as some nRF5x development boards, however, instructions from the
:ref:`nordic_segger` page also apply to this board, with the additional step
of connecting an external debugger. The USB-SWD programmer board has a CMSIS debugger
compatible interface and debugging can be performed using pyocd, openocd or any other
applications that support the CMSIS interface.

Testing Bluetooth on the BT510
***********************************
Many of the Bluetooth examples will work on the BT510.
Try them out:

* :ref:`ble_peripheral`
* :ref:`bluetooth-eddystone-sample`
* :ref:`bluetooth-ibeacon-sample`


Testing the LEDs and buttons on the BT510
*****************************************

There are 2 samples that allow you to test that the buttons (switches) and LEDs on
the board are working properly with Zephyr:

* :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky`
* :zephyr:code-sample:`button`

You can build and flash the examples to make sure Zephyr is running correctly on
your board. The button, LED and sensor device definitions can be found in
:zephyr_file:`boards/lairdconnect/bt510/bt510.dts`.
