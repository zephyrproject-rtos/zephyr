Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``bl654_dvk`` board configuration can be built, flashed,
and debugged in the usual way. See :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details on building and running.

Flashing
========

Follow the instructions in the :ref:`nordic_segger` page to install
and configure all the necessary software. Further information can be
found in :ref:`nordic_segger_flashing`. Then build and flash
applications as usual (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

First, run your favorite terminal program to listen for output.

NOTE: On the BL654 DVK, the FTDI USB should be used to access the UART console.

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D <tty_device> -b 115200

Replace :code:`<tty_device>` with the port where the board nRF52 DK
can be found. For example, under Linux, :code:`/dev/ttyUSB0`.

Then build and flash the application in the usual way.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: bl654_dvk
   :goals: build flash

Debugging
=========

Refer to the :ref:`nordic_segger` page to learn about debugging Nordic based boards with a
Segger IC.

Testing Bluetooth on the BL654 DVK
***********************************
Many of the Bluetooth examples will work on the BL654 DVK.
Try them out:

* :ref:`ble_peripheral`
* :ref:`bluetooth-eddystone-sample`
* :ref:`bluetooth-ibeacon-sample`


Testing the LEDs and buttons on the BL654 DVK
************************************************

There are 2 samples that allow you to test that the buttons (switches) and LEDs on
the board are working properly with Zephyr:

* :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky`
* :zephyr:code-sample:`button`

You can build and flash the examples to make sure Zephyr is running correctly on
your board. The button and LED definitions can be found in
:zephyr_file:`boards/lairdconnect/bl654_dvk/bl654_dvk.dts`.
