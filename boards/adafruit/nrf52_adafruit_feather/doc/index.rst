Connections and IOs
===================

The `Adafruit Feather nRF52 Bluefruit Learning Guide`_ has detailed
information about the board including `pinouts`_ and the `schematic`_.

LED
---

* LED0 (red) = P0.17
* LED1 (blue) = P0.19

Push buttons
------------

* DFU = SW0 = P0.20
* RESET = SW1 = P0.21/reset

Programming and Debugging
*************************

The ``nrf52_adafruit_feather`` board is available in two different versions:

- `Adafruit Feather nRF52 Pro with myNewt Bootloader`_
   This board version is the recommended one to use. It has the SWD header
   already populated and comes with the  Mynewt serial bootloader installed by
   default.

- `Adafruit Feather nRF52 Bluefruit LE`_
   This board is identical to the board above, but the SWD header is not
   populated and ships with an Arduino friendly bootloader. To be able to work
   with this version a 2*5pin 0.5" SWD header (e.g. `Adafruit SWD connector`_)
   needs to be soldered.

Applications for the ``nrf52_adafruit_feather`` board configuration can be
built, flashed, and debugged in the usual way. See :ref:`build_an_application`
and :ref:`application_run` for more details on building and running.

Flashing
========

Flashing Zephyr onto the ``nrf52_adafruit_feather`` board requires an external
J-Link programmer. The programmer is attached to the X1 SWD header.

Follow the instructions in the :ref:`nordic_segger` page to install
and configure all the necessary software. Further information can be
found in :ref:`nordic_segger_flashing`. Then build and flash
applications as usual (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.


#. Build the Zephyr kernel and the :ref:`hello_world` sample application:

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
      :board: nrf52_adafruit_feather
      :goals: build
      :compact:

#. Connect the Adafruit nRF52 Feather to your host computer using USB

#. Run your favorite terminal program to listen for output.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ minicom -D <tty_device> -b 115200

   Replace :code:`<tty_device>` with the port where the nRF52 Adafruit Feather
   board can be found. For example, under Linux, :code:`/dev/ttyUSB0`.

#. Flash the image:

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
      :board: nrf52_adafruit_feather
      :goals: flash
      :compact:

   You should see "Hello World! nrf52_adafruit_feather" in your terminal.


Debugging
=========

The ``nrf52_adafruit_feather`` board does not have an on-board J-Link debug IC
as some nRF5x development boards, however, instructions from the
:ref:`nordic_segger` page also apply to this board, with the additional step
of connecting an external debugger.


Testing the LEDs and buttons on the nRF52 Adafruit Feather
**********************************************************

There are several samples that allow you to test that the buttons (switches) and LEDs on
the board are working properly with Zephyr:

- :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky`
- :zephyr:code-sample:`button`
- :zephyr:code-sample:`fade-led`
- :zephyr:code-sample:`pwm-blinky`
- :zephyr:code-sample:`multi-thread-blinky`

You can build and flash the examples to make sure Zephyr is running correctly on
your board. The button and LED definitions can be found in
:zephyr_file:`boards/adafruit/nrf52_adafruit_feather/board.h`.
