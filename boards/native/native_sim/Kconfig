	help
	  When this option is set the native_sim board will pretend to be
	  a native_posix board from kconfig point of view, to allow using it directly with
	  code which was meant for the native_posix board and checks for the macro
	  CONFIG_BOARD_NATIVE_POSIX, or requires other kconfig options which depend on it.
	  This option is deprecated and will be removed in Zephyr v4.3

	  When selected the execution of the process will be slowed down to real time.
	  (if there is a lot of load it may be slower than real time)
	  If deselected, the process will run as fast as possible.
	  Note that this only decouples simulated time from real/wall time. In either
	  case the zephyr kernel and application cannot tell the difference unless they
	  interact with some other driver/device which runs at real time.

	  to set the correct native_sim option (CONFIG_NATIVE_SIM_SLOWDOWN_TO_REAL_TIME)
