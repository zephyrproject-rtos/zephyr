Overview
********

The RW612 is a highly integrated, low-power tri-radio wireless MCU with an
integrated 260 MHz ARM Cortex-M33 MCU and Wi-Fi 6 + Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) 5.3 / 802.15.4
radios designed for a broad array of applications, including connected smart home devices,
gaming controllers, enterprise and industrial automation, smart accessories and smart energy.

The RW612 MCU subsystem includes 1.2 MB of on-chip SRAM and a high-bandwidth Quad SPI interface
with an on-the-fly decryption engine for securely accessing off-chip XIP flash.

The advanced design of the RW612 delivers tight integration, low power and highly secure
operation in a space- and cost-efficient wireless MCU requiring only a single 3.3â€¯V power supply.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Build and flash applications as usual (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Configuring a Debug Probe
=========================

A debug probe is used for both flashing and debugging the board. This board is
configured by default to use the JLink Firmware.

Configuring a Console
=====================

Connect a USB cable from your PC to J10, and use the serial terminal of your choice
(minicom, putty, etc.) with the following settings:

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1

Flashing
========

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application. This example uses the
:ref:`jlink-debug-host-tools` as default.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: frdm_rw612
   :goals: flash

Open a serial terminal, reset the board (press the RESET button), and you should
see the following message in the terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   ***** Booting Zephyr OS v3.6.0 *****
   Hello World! frdm_rw612

Debugging
=========

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application. This example uses the
:ref:`jlink-debug-host-tools` as default.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: frdm_rw612
   :goals: debug

Open a serial terminal, step through the application in your debugger, and you
should see the following message in the terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   ***** Booting Zephyr OS zephyr-v3.6.0 *****
   Hello World! frdm_rw612

SRAM Bus Access Partitioning
****************************

RW612 supports shared access of the SRAM from both the code bus and data bus.
The bus used to access the SRAM is determined using two separate memory mapped address spaces.
The application can configure the partitioning of the SRAM access regions by a devicetree overlay.
For example, below is part of an overlay to change the whole SRAM to be used for data.

.. code-block:: devicetree

   &sram_data {
        reg = <0x0 DT_SIZE_K(1216)>;
   };


Wireless Connectivity Support
*****************************

Fetch Binary Blobs
==================

To support Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, frdm_rw612 requires fetching binary blobs, which can be
achieved by running the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   west blobs fetch hal_nxp

Bluetooth
=========

BLE functionality requires to fetch binary blobs, so make sure to follow
the ``Fetch Binary Blobs`` section first.

frdm_rw612 platform supports the monolithic feature. The required binary blob
``<zephyr workspace>/modules/hal/nxp/zephyr/blobs/rw61x_sb_ble_a2.bin`` will be linked
with the application image directly, forming one single monolithic image.

Wi-Fi
=====

Wi-Fi functionality requires to fetch binary blobs, so make sure to follow
the ``Fetch Binary Blobs`` section first.

frdm_rw612 platform supports the monolithic feature. The required binary blob
``<zephyr workspace>/modules/hal/nxp/zephyr/blobs/rw61x_sb_wifi_a2.bin`` will be linked
with the application image directly, forming one single monolithic image.
