Overview
********

The MCXW72-EVK

The MCX W72x family features a 96 MHz Arm® Cortex®-M33 core coupled with a
multiprotocol radio subsystem supporting Matter, Thread, Zigbee and
Bluetooth LE. The independent radio subsystem, with a dedicated core and
memory, offloads the main CPU, preserving it for the primary application and
allowing firmware updates to support future wireless standards.

Hardware
********

- MCXW72 Arm Cortex-M33 microcontroller running up to 96 MHz
- 2MB on-chip Flash memory unit
- 256 KB TCM RAM
- On-board MCU-Link debugger with CMSIS-DAP

Fetch Binary Blobs
******************

To support Bluetooth, mcxw72_evk requires fetching binary blobs, which can be
achieved by running the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   west blobs fetch hal_nxp

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Build and flash applications as usual (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Configuring a Debug Probe
=========================

A debug probe is used for both flashing and debugging the board. This board is
configured by default to use the MCU-Link CMSIS-DAP Onboard Debug Probe.

Using LinkServer
----------------

Linkserver is the default runner for this board, and supports the factory
default MCU-Link firmware. Follow the instructions in
:ref:`mcu-link-cmsis-onboard-debug-probe` to reprogram the default MCU-Link
firmware. This only needs to be done if the default onboard debug circuit
firmware was changed. To put the board in ``DFU mode`` to program the firmware,
short jumper JP20.

Using J-Link
------------

There are two options. The onboard debug circuit can be updated with Segger
J-Link firmware by following the instructions in
:ref:`mcu-link-jlink-onboard-debug-probe`.
To be able to program the firmware, you need to put the board in ``DFU mode``
by shortening the jumper JP20.
The second option is to attach a :ref:`jlink-external-debug-probe` to the
10-pin SWD connector (J16) of the board.
For both options use the ``-r jlink`` option with west to use the jlink runner.

.. code-block:: console

   west flash -r jlink

Configuring a Console
=====================

Connect a USB cable from your PC to J14, and use the serial terminal of your choice
(minicom, putty, etc.) with the following settings:

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1

Flashing
========

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: mcxw72_evk/mcxw727c/cpu0
   :goals: flash

Open a serial terminal, reset the board (press the RESET button), and you should
see the following message in the terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   *** Booting Zephyr OS build v3.7.0-xxx-xxxx ***
   Hello World! mcxw72_evk/mcxw727c/cpu0

Debugging
=========

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: mcxw72_evk/mcxw727c/cpu0
   :goals: debug

Open a serial terminal, step through the application in your debugger, and you
should see the following message in the terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   *** Booting Zephyr OS build v3.7.0-xxx-xxxx ***
   Hello World! mcxw72_evk/mcxw727c/cpu0

Bluetooth
=========

BLE functionality requires to fetch binary blobs, so make sure to follow
the ``Fetch Binary Blobs`` section first.

Two images must be written to the board: one for the host (CM33 core0) and one for the NBU (CM33 core1).
- To flash the application (CM33) refer to the ``Flashing`` section above.
- To flash the NBU, follow the instructions below:

.. code-block:: console

	JLinkExe -device MCXW727C_CORE1 -if SWD -speed 4000 -autoconnect 1
	J-Link>loadbin <path to nbu blob file> 0x0
