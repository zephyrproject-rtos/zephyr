Targets available
==================

The default configuration file
:zephyr_file:`boards/nxp/mcx_n9xx_evk/mcx_n9xx_evk_mcxn947_cpu0_defconfig`
only enables the first core. CPU0 is the only target that can run standalone.

CPU1 does not work without CPU0 enabling it.

To enable CPU1, create System Build application project and enable the
second core with config :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SECOND_CORE_MCUX`.

Please have a look at some already enabled samples:

- :zephyr:code-sample:`ipc-static-vrings`
- :zephyr:code-sample:`openamp`
- :zephyr:code-sample:`mbox`
- :zephyr:code-sample:`mbox_data`

Connections and IOs
===================

The MCX-N947 SoC has 6 gpio controllers and has pinmux registers which
can be used to configure the functionality of a pin.

+------------+-----------------+----------------------------+

System Clock
============

The MCX-N947 SoC is configured to use PLL0 running at 150MHz as a source for
the system clock.

Serial Port
===========

The MCX-N9XX-EVK SoC has 10 FLEXCOMM interfaces for serial communication.
Flexcomm 4 is configured as UART for the console.

Ethernet
========
To use networking samples with the Ethernet jack, change jumper JP13 to pins 2-3.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Build and flash applications as usual (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Configuring a Debug Probe
=========================

A debug probe is used for both flashing and debugging the board. This board is
configured by default to use the MCU-Link CMSIS-DAP Onboard Debug Probe.

Using LinkServer
----------------

LinkServer is the default runner for this board, and supports the factory
default MCU-Link firmware. Follow the instructions in
:ref:`mcu-link-cmsis-onboard-debug-probe` to reprogram the default MCU-Link
firmware. This only needs to be done if the default onboard debug circuit
firmware was changed. To put the board in ``ISP mode`` to program the firmware,
short jumper JP24.

Using J-Link
------------

There are two options. The onboard debug circuit can be updated with Segger
J-Link firmware by following the instructions in
:ref:`mcu-link-jlink-onboard-debug-probe`.
To be able to program the firmware, you need to put the board in ``ISP mode``
by shortening the jumper JP24.
The second option is to attach a :ref:`jlink-external-debug-probe` to the
20-pin SWD connector (J11) of the board. Additionally, the jumper JP6 must
be shorted.
For both options use the ``-r jlink`` option with west to use the jlink runner.

.. code-block:: console

   west flash -r jlink

Configuring a Console
=====================

Connect a USB cable from your PC to J5, and use the serial terminal of your choice
(minicom, putty, etc.) with the following settings:

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1

Flashing
========

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: mcx_n9xx_evk/mcxn947/cpu0
   :goals: flash

Open a serial terminal, reset the board (press the RESET button), and you should
see the following message in the terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   *** Booting Zephyr OS build vX.X.X ***
   Hello World! mcx_n9xx_evk/mcxn947/cpu0

Building a dual-core image
==========================

The dual-core samples are run using ``mcx_n9xx_evk/mcxn947/cpu0`` target.

Images built for ``mcx_n9xx_evk/mcxn947/cpu1`` will be loaded from flash
and executed on the second core when :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SECOND_CORE_MCUX` is selected.

For an example of building for both cores with System Build, see
:zephyr:code-sample:`ipc-static-vrings`

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`mbox_data` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :app: zephyr/samples/drivers/mbox_data
   :board: mcx_n9xx_evk/mcxn947/cpu0
   :goals: flash
   :west-args: --sysbuild

Flashing to QSPI
================

In order to load Zephyr application from QSPI, program a bootloader like
MCUboot bootloader to internal flash. Here are the steps for the
:zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :app: zephyr/samples/hello_world
   :board: mcx_n9xx_evk/mcxn947/cpu0/qspi
   :gen-args: --sysbuild -- -DSB_CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT=y
   :goals: flash

Open a serial terminal, reset the board (press the RESET button), and you should
see the following message in the terminal:

.. code-block:: console

  *** Booting MCUboot vX.X.X ***
  *** Using Zephyr OS build vX.X.X ***
  I: Starting bootloader
  I: Primary image: magic=unset, swap_type=0x1, copy_done=0x3, image_ok=0x3
  I: Secondary image: magic=unset, swap_type=0x1, copy_done=0x3, image_ok=0x3
  I: Boot source: none
  I: Image index: 0, Swap type: none
  I: Bootloader chainload address offset: 0x0
  I: Jumping to the first image slot
  *** Booting Zephyr OS build vX.X.X ***
  Hello World! mcx_n9xx_evk/mcxn947/cpu0/qspi

Debugging
=========

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: mcx_n9xx_evk/mcxn947/cpu0
   :goals: debug

Open a serial terminal, step through the application in your debugger, and you
should see the following message in the terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   *** Booting Zephyr OS build vX.X.X ***
   Hello World! mcx_n9xx_evk/mcxn947/cpu0

Debugging a dual-core image
---------------------------

For dual core builds, the secondary core should be placed into a loop,
then a debugger can be attached.
As a reference please see (`AN13264`_, section 4.2.3 for more information).
The reference is for the RT1170 but similar technique can be also used here.
