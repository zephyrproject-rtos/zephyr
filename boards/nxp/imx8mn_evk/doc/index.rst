Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

Devices
========
System Clock
------------

This board configuration uses a system clock frequency of 8 MHz.

Serial Port
-----------

This board configuration uses a single serial communication channel with the
CPU's UART4.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

.. zephyr:board-supported-runners::

There are multiple methods to program and debug Zephyr on the A53 core:

Option 1. Boot Zephyr by Using JLink Runner
===========================================

The default runner for the board is JLink, connect the EVK board's JTAG connector to
the host computer using a J-Link debugger, power up the board and stop the board at
U-Boot command line.

Then use "west flash" or "west debug" command to load the zephyr.bin
image from the host computer and start the Zephyr application on A53 core0.

Flash and Run
-------------

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :host-os: unix
   :board: imx8mn_evk/mimx8mn6/a53
   :goals: flash

Then the following log could be found on UART4 console:

.. code-block:: console

    *** Booting Zephyr OS build v4.1.0-3063-g38519ca2c028 ***
    Hello World! imx8mn_evk/mimx8mn6/a53

Debug
-----

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :host-os: unix
   :board: imx8mn_evk/mimx8mn6/a53
   :goals: debug

Option 2. Boot Zephyr by Using U-Boot Command
=============================================

U-Boot "cpu" command is used to load and kick Zephyr to Cortex-A secondary Core, Currently
it has been supported in latest U-Boot version by `patch serials`_.

Step 1: Download Zephyr Image into DDR Memory
---------------------------------------------

Firstly need to download Zephyr binary image into DDR memory, it can use tftp:

.. code-block:: console

    tftp 0x93c00000 zephyr.bin

Or copy the Zephyr image ``zephyr.bin`` SD card and plug the card into the board, for example
if copy to the FAT partition of the SD card, use the following U-Boot command to load the image
into DDR memory (assuming the SD card is dev 1, fat partition ID is 1, they could be changed
based on actual setup):

.. code-block:: console

    fatload mmc 1:1 0x93c00000 zephyr.bin;

Step 2: Boot Zephyr
-------------------

Then use the following command to boot Zephyr on the core0:

.. code-block:: console

    dcache off; icache flush; go 0x93c00000;

Or use "cpu" command to boot from secondary Core, for example Core1:

.. code-block:: console

    dcache flush; icache flush; cpu 1 release 0x93c00000

Use this configuration to run basic Zephyr applications and kernel tests,
for example, with the :zephyr:code-sample:`synchronization` sample:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/synchronization
   :host-os: unix
   :board: imx8mn_evk/mimx8mn6/a53
   :goals: build

This will build an image with the synchronization sample app, boot it and
display the following ram console output:

.. code-block:: console

    *** Booting Zephyr OS build v4.1.0-3063-g38519ca2c028 ***
    thread_a: Hello World from cpu 0 on mimx8mn_evk!
    thread_b: Hello World from cpu 0 on mimx8mn_evk!
    thread_a: Hello World from cpu 0 on mimx8mn_evk!
    thread_b: Hello World from cpu 0 on mimx8mn_evk!
    thread_a: Hello World from cpu 0 on mimx8mn_evk!
