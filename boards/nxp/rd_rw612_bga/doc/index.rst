NXP RD-RW612-BGA
################

Overview
********

The RW612 is a highly integrated, low-power tri-radio wireless MCU with an
integrated 260 MHz ARM Cortex-M33 MCU and Wi-Fi 6 + Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) 5.3 / 802.15.4
radios designed for a broad array of applications, including connected smart home devices,
gaming controllers, enterprise and industrial automation, smart accessories and smart energy.

The RW612 MCU subsystem includes 1.2 MB of on-chip SRAM and a high-bandwidth Quad SPI interface
with an on-the-fly decryption engine for securely accessing off-chip XIP flash.

The advanced design of the RW612 delivers tight integration, low power and highly secure
operation in a space- and cost-efficient wireless MCU requiring only a single 3.3â€¯V power supply.

Other hardware features are not currently supported

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Build and flash applications as usual (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Configuring a Debug Probe
=========================

A debug probe is used for both flashing and debugging the board. This board is
configured by default to use the JLink Firmware.

Configuring a Console
=====================

Connect a USB cable from your PC to J7, and use the serial terminal of your choice
(minicom, putty, etc.) with the following settings:

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1

Flashing
========

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application. This example uses the
:ref:`jlink-debug-host-tools` as default.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: rd_rw612_bga
   :goals: flash

Open a serial terminal, reset the board (press the RESET button), and you should
see the following message in the terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   ***** Booting Zephyr OS v3.4.0 *****
   Hello World! rd_rw612_bga

Debugging
=========

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application. This example uses the
:ref:`jlink-debug-host-tools` as default.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: rd_rw612_bga
   :goals: debug

Open a serial terminal, step through the application in your debugger, and you
should see the following message in the terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   ***** Booting Zephyr OS zephyr-v3.6.0 *****
   Hello World! rd_rw612_bga
