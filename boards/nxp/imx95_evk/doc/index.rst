Programming and Debugging (A55)
*******************************

.. zephyr:board-supported-runners::

There are multiple methods to program and run Zephyr on the A55 core:

Option 1. Boot Zephyr by Using SPSDK Runner
===========================================

SPSDK runner leverages SPSDK tools (https://spsdk.readthedocs.io), it builds an
bootable flash image ``flash.bin`` which includes all necessary firmware components,
such as ELE+V2X firmware, System Manager, TCM OEI, TF-A images etc. Using west flash
command will download the boot image flash.bin to DDR memory, SD card or eMMC flash.
By using flash.bin, as no U-Boot image is available, so TF-A will boot up Zephyr on
the first Cortex-A55 Core directly.

In order to use SPSDK runner, it requires fetching binary blobs, which can be achieved
by running the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   west blobs fetch hal_nxp

.. note::

   It is recommended running the command above after :file:`west update`.

SPSDK runner is enabled by configure item :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOARD_NXP_SPSDK_IMAGE`, currently
it is not enabled by default for i.MX95 EVK board, so use this configuration to enable
it, for example, with the :zephyr:code-sample:`synchronization` sample:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/synchronization
   :host-os: unix
   :board: imx95_evk/mimx9596/a55
   :goals: build
   :gen-args: -DCONFIG_BOARD_NXP_SPSDK_IMAGE=y

If :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOARD_NXP_SPSDK_IMAGE` is available and enabled for the board variant,
``flash.bin`` will be built automatically. The programming could be through below commands.
Before that, switch SW7[1:4] should be configured to 0b1001 for usb download mode
to boot, and USB1 and DBG ports should be connected to PC. There are 4 serial ports
enumerated (115200 8n1), and we use the first for M7 and the fourth for M33 System Manager.
(The flasher is spsdk which already installed via scripts/requirements.txt.
On linux host, usb device permission should be configured per Installation Guide
of https://spsdk.readthedocs.io)

.. code-block:: none

   # load and run without programming. for next flashing, execute 'reset' in the
   # fourth serail port
   $ west flash

   # program to SD card, then set SW7[1:4]=0b1011 to reboot
   $ west flash --bootdevice sd

   # program to emmc card, then set SW7[1:4]=0b1010 to reboot
   $ west flash --bootdevice=emmc


Option 2. Boot Zephyr by Using U-Boot Command
=============================================

U-Boot "go" command can be used to start Zephyr on A55 core0 and U-Boot "cpu" command
is used to load and kick Zephyr to the other A55 secondary Cores. Currently "cpu" command
is supported in : `Real-Time Edge U-Boot`_ (use the branch "uboot_vxxxx.xx-y.y.y,
xxxx.xx is uboot version and y.y.y is Real-Time Edge Software version, for example
"uboot_v2023.04-2.9.0" branch is U-Boot v2023.04 used in Real-Time Edge Software release
v2.9.0), and pre-build images and user guide can be found at `Real-Time Edge Software`_.

.. _Real-Time Edge Software:
   https://www.nxp.com/rtedge

Step 1: Download Zephyr Image into DDR Memory
---------------------------------------------

Firstly need to download Zephyr binary image into DDR memory, it can use tftp:

.. code-block:: console

    tftp 0xd0000000 zephyr.bin

Or copy the Zephyr image ``zephyr.bin`` SD card and plug the card into the board, for example
if copy to the FAT partition of the SD card, use the following U-Boot command to load the image
into DDR memory (assuming the SD card is dev 1, fat partition ID is 1, they could be changed
based on actual setup):

.. code-block:: console

    fatload mmc 1:1 0xd0000000 zephyr.bin;

Step 2: Boot Zephyr
-------------------

Use this configuration to run basic Zephyr applications and kernel tests,
for example, with the :zephyr:code-sample:`synchronization` sample:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/synchronization
   :host-os: unix
   :board: imx95_evk/mimx9596/a55
   :goals: build

This will build an image (zephyr.bin) with the synchronization sample app.

Then use the following command to boot Zephyr on the core0:

.. code-block:: console

    dcache off; icache flush; go 0xd0000000;

Or use "cpu" command to boot from secondary Core, for example Core1:

.. code-block:: console

    dcache flush; icache flush; cpu 1 release 0xd0000000

It will display the following console output:

.. code-block:: console

    *** Booting Zephyr OS build v3.6.0-4569-g483c01ca11a7 ***
    thread_a: Hello World from cpu 0 on imx95_evk!
    thread_b: Hello World from cpu 0 on imx95_evk!
    thread_a: Hello World from cpu 0 on imx95_evk!
    thread_b: Hello World from cpu 0 on imx95_evk!
    thread_a: Hello World from cpu 0 on imx95_evk!

Option 3. Boot Zephyr by Using Remoteproc under Linux
=====================================================

When running Linux on the A55 core, it can use the remoteproc framework to load and boot Zephyr,
refer to Real-Time Edge user guide for more details. Pre-build images and user guide can be found
at `Real-Time Edge Software`_.


Programming and Debugging (M7)
******************************

The i.MX System Manager (SM) is used on i.MX95, which is an application that runs on
Cortex-M33 processor. The Cortex-M33 is the boot core, runs the boot ROM which loads
the SM (and other boot code), and then branches to the SM. The SM then configures some
aspects of the hardware such as isolation mechanisms and then starts other cores in the
system. After starting these cores, it enters a service mode where it provides access
to clocking, power, sensor, and pin control via a client RPC API based on ARM's
`System Control and Management Interface (SCMI)`_.

To program M7, an i.MX container image ``flash.bin`` must be made, which contains
multiple elements required, like ELE+V2X firmware, System Manager, TCM OEI, Cortex-M7
image and so on.

SPSDK runner is used to build ``flash.bin``, and it requires fetching binary blobs, which
can be achieved by running the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   west blobs fetch hal_nxp

.. note::

   It is recommended running the command above after :file:`west update`.

Two methods to build and program ``flash.bin``.

1. If :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOARD_NXP_SPSDK_IMAGE` is not available for the board variant,
the steps making flash.bin and programming should refer to ``Getting Started with
MCUXpresso SDK for IMX95LPD5EVK-19.pdf`` in i.MX95 `MCUX SDK release`_. Note that
for the DDR variant, one should use the Makefile targets containing the ``ddr`` keyword.
See ``4.2 Run an example application``, just rename ``zephyr.bin`` to ``m7_image.bin``
to make flash.bin and program to SD/eMMC.

2. If :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOARD_NXP_SPSDK_IMAGE` is available and enabled for the board variant,
``flash.bin`` will be built automatically. The programming could be through below commands.
Before that, switch SW7[1:4] should be configured to 0b1001 for usb download mode
to boot, and USB1 and DBG ports should be connected to PC. There are 4 serial ports
enumerated (115200 8n1), and we use the first for M7 and the fourth for M33 System Manager.
(The flasher is spsdk which already installed via scripts/requirements.txt.
On linux host, usb device permission should be configured per Installation Guide
of https://spsdk.readthedocs.io)

.. code-block:: none

   # load and run without programming. for next flashing, execute 'reset' in the
   # fourth serail port
   $ west flash

   # program to SD card, then set SW7[1:4]=0b1011 to reboot
   $ west flash --bootdevice sd

   # program to emmc card, then set SW7[1:4]=0b1010 to reboot
   $ west flash --bootdevice=emmc

Zephyr supports two M7-based i.MX95 boards: ``imx95_evk/mimx9596/m7`` and
``imx95_evk/mimx9596/m7/ddr``. The main difference between them is the memory
used. ``imx95_evk/mimx9596/m7`` uses TCM (ITCM for code and, generally, read-only
data and DTCM for R/W data), while ``imx95_evk/mimx9596/m7/ddr`` uses DDR.

1. Building the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application for the TCM-based board

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: imx95_evk/mimx9596/m7
   :goals: build

2. Building the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application for the DDR-based board

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: imx95_evk/mimx9596/m7/ddr
   :goals: build

After making flash.bin and program to SD/eMMC, open a serial terminal, and reset the
board. For the ``imx95_evk/mimx9596/m7`` board you should see something like:

.. code-block:: console

   *** Booting Zephyr OS build v3.6.0-4569-g483c01ca11a7 ***
   Hello World! imx95_evk/mimx9596/m7

while, for the ``imx95_evk/mimx9596/m7/ddr`` board, you should get the following output:

.. code-block:: console

   *** Booting Zephyr OS build v3.6.0-4569-g483c01ca11a7 ***
   Hello World! imx95_evk/mimx9596/m7/ddr
