Programming and Debugging (A55)
*******************************

Use this configuration to run basic Zephyr applications and kernel tests,
for example, with the :zephyr:code-sample:`synchronization` sample:

1. Build and run the Non-SMP application

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/synchronization
   :host-os: unix
   :board: imx95_evk/mimx9596/a55
   :goals: build

This will build an image (zephyr.bin) with the synchronization sample app.

Copy the compiled ``zephyr.bin`` to the first FAT partition of the SD card and
plug the SD card into the board. Power it up and stop the u-boot execution at
prompt.

Use U-Boot to load and kick zephyr.bin to Cortex-A55 Core1:

.. code-block:: console

    fatload mmc 1:1 0xd0000000 zephyr.bin; dcache flush; icache flush; cpu 1 release 0xd0000000


Or use the following command to kick zephyr.bin to Cortex-A55 Core0:

.. code-block:: console

    fatload mmc 1:1 0xd0000000 zephyr.bin; dcache flush; icache flush; go 0xd0000000


It will display the following console output:

.. code-block:: console

    *** Booting Zephyr OS build v3.6.0-4569-g483c01ca11a7 ***
    thread_a: Hello World from cpu 0 on imx95_evk!
    thread_b: Hello World from cpu 0 on imx95_evk!
    thread_a: Hello World from cpu 0 on imx95_evk!
    thread_b: Hello World from cpu 0 on imx95_evk!
    thread_a: Hello World from cpu 0 on imx95_evk!

2. Build and run the SMP application

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/synchronization
   :host-os: unix
   :board: imx95_evk/mimx9596/a55/smp
   :goals: build

This will build an image (zephyr.bin) with the synchronization sample app.

Copy the compiled ``zephyr.bin`` to the first FAT partition of the SD card and
plug the SD card into the board. Power it up and stop the u-boot execution at
prompt.

Use the following command to kick zephyr.bin to Cortex-A55 Core0:

.. code-block:: console

    fatload mmc 1:1 0xd0000000 zephyr.bin; dcache flush; icache flush; go 0xd0000000


It will display the following console output:
.. code-block:: console

Programming and Debugging (M7)
******************************

The i.MX System Manager (SM) is used on i.MX95, which is an application that runs on
Cortex-M33 processor. The Cortex-M33 is the boot core, runs the boot ROM which loads
the SM (and other boot code), and then branches to the SM. The SM then configures some
aspects of the hardware such as isolation mechanisms and then starts other cores in the
system. After starting these cores, it enters a service mode where it provides access
to clocking, power, sensor, and pin control via a client RPC API based on ARM's
`System Control and Management Interface (SCMI)`_.

To program M7, an i.MX container image ``flash.bin`` must be made, which contains
multiple elements required, like ELE+V2X firmware, System Manager, TCM OEI, Cortex-M7
image and so on.

The steps making flash.bin and programming should refer to ``Getting Started with
MCUXpresso SDK for IMX95LPD5EVK-19.pdf`` in i.MX95 `MCUX SDK release`_. Note that
for the DDR variant, one should use the Makefile targets containing the ``ddr`` keyword.

See ``4.2 Run an example application``, just rename ``zephyr.bin`` to ``m7_image.bin``
to make flash.bin and program to SD/eMMC.

Zephyr supports two M7-based i.MX95 boards: ``imx95_evk/mimx9596/m7`` and
``imx95_evk/mimx9596/m7/ddr``. The main difference between them is the memory
used. ``imx95_evk/mimx9596/m7`` uses TCM (ITCM for code and, generally, read-only
data and DTCM for R/W data), while ``imx95_evk/mimx9596/m7/ddr`` uses DDR.

1. Building the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application for the TCM-based board

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: imx95_evk/mimx9596/m7
   :goals: build

2. Building the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application for the DDR-based board

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: imx95_evk/mimx9596/m7/ddr
   :goals: build

After making flash.bin and program to SD/eMMC, open a serial terminal, and reset the
board. For the ``imx95_evk/mimx9596/m7`` board you should see something like:

.. code-block:: console

   *** Booting Zephyr OS build v3.6.0-4569-g483c01ca11a7 ***
   Hello World! imx95_evk/mimx9596/m7

while, for the ``imx95_evk/mimx9596/m7/ddr`` board, you should get the following output:

.. code-block:: console

   *** Booting Zephyr OS build v3.6.0-4569-g483c01ca11a7 ***
   Hello World! imx95_evk/mimx9596/m7/ddr
