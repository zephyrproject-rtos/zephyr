NXP FRDM-MCXN947
################

Overview
********

FRDM-MCXN947 are compact and scalable development boards for rapid prototyping of
MCX N94 and N54 MCUs. They offer industry standard headers for easy access to the
MCUs I/Os, integrated open-standard serial interfaces, external flash memory and
an on-board MCU-Link debugger. MCX N Series are high-performance, low-power
microcontrollers with intelligent peripherals and accelerators providing multi-tasking
capabilities and performance efficiency.

Targets available
==================

The default configuration file
zephyr_file:`boards/nxp/frdm_mcxn947/frdm_mcxn947_mcxn947_cpu0_defconfig`
only enables the first core.

Other hardware features are not currently supported by the port.`

Connections and IOs
===================

The MCX-N947 SoC has 6 gpio controllers and has pinmux registers which
can be used to configure the functionality of a pin.

+------------+-----------------+----------------------------+
| Name       | Function        | Usage                      |
+============+=================+============================+
| P0_PIO1_8  | UART            | UART RX                    |

| P1_PIO1_9  | UART            | UART TX                    |
+------------+-----------------+----------------------------+

System Clock
============

The MCX-N947 SoC is configured to use PLL0 running at 150MHz as a source for
the system clock.

Serial Port
===========

The FRDM-MCXN947 SoC has 10 FLEXCOMM interfaces for serial communication.
Flexcomm 4 is configured as UART for the console.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Build and flash applications as usual (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Configuring a Debug Probe
=========================

A debug probe is used for both flashing and debugging the board. This board is
configured by default to use the MCU-Link CMSIS-DAP Onboard Debug Probe.

Using LinkServer
----------------

Linkserver is the default runner for this board. Follow the instructions in
:ref:`mcu-link-cmsis-onboard-debug-probe` to progtam the MCU-Link firmware.
This only needs to be done if the default onboard debug circuit firmware was changed.
To put the board in ``DFU mode`` to program the firmware, short jumper J21.

Using J-Link
------------

There are two options. The onboard debug circuit can be updated with Segger
J-Link firmware by following the instructions in
:ref:`mcu-link-jlink-onboard-debug-probe`.
To put the board in ``DFU mode`` to program the firmware, short jumper J21.
The second option is to attach :ref:`jlink-external-debug-probe` to the
board.

Use the ``-r jlink`` option with west to use the jlink runner.

.. code-block:: console

   west flash -r jlink

Configuring a Console
=====================

Connect a USB cable from your PC to J17, and use the serial terminal of your choice
(minicom, putty, etc.) with the following settings:

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1

Flashing
========

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: frdm_mcxn947/mcxn947/cpu0
   :goals: flash

Open a serial terminal, reset the board (press the RESET button), and you should
see the following message in the terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   *** Booting Zephyr OS build v3.6.0-479-g91faa20c6741 ***
   Hello World! frdm_mcxn947

Debugging
=========

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: frdm_mcxn947/mcxn947/cpu0
   :goals: debug

Open a serial terminal, step through the application in your debugger, and you
should see the following message in the terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   *** Booting Zephyr OS build v3.6.0-479-g91faa20c6741 ***
   Hello World! frdm_mcxn947
