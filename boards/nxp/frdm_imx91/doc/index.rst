Overview
********

The FRDM-IMX91 board is a low-cost and compact platform designed to show
the most commonly used features of the i.MX 91 Applications Processor in a
small and low cost package. The FRDM-IMX93 board is an entry-level development
board, which helps developers to get familiar with the processor before
investing a large amount of resources in more specific designs.

Hardware
********

- i.MX 91 applications processor

  - The i.MX 91 Applications Processor features an Arm CortexÂ®-A55 core
    that can operate at speeds of up to 1.4 GHz.

  - JTAG 20-pin connector
  - MicroUSB for UART debug


Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

Devices
========
System Clock
------------

This board configuration uses a system clock frequency of 24 MHz.
Cortex-A55 Core runs up to 1.4 GHz.

Serial Port
-----------

This board configuration uses a single serial communication channel with the
CPU's UART1 for A55 core.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

U-Boot "go" command is used to load and kick Zephyr to Cortex-A55 Core.

Stop the board at U-Boot command line, then need to download Zephyr binary image into
DDR memory, it can use tftp:

.. code-block:: console

    tftp 0x80000000 zephyr.bin

Or copy the Zephyr image ``zephyr.bin`` to SD card and plug the card into the board, for example
if copy the image to the FAT partition of the SD card, use the following U-Boot command to load
the image into DDR memory (assuming the SD card is dev 1, fat partition ID is 1, they could be
changed based on actual partitions):

.. code-block:: console

    fatload mmc 1:1 0x80000000 zephyr.bin;


Then use U-Boot to load and kick zephyr.bin to Cortex-A55 Core:

.. code-block:: console

    dcache off; icache flush; go 0x80000000

Use this configuration to run basic Zephyr applications and kernel tests,
for example, with the :zephyr:code-sample:`synchronization` sample:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/synchronization
   :host-os: unix
   :board: frdm_imx91/mimx9131
   :goals: build

This will build an image with the synchronization sample app, boot it and
display the following console output:

.. code-block:: console
