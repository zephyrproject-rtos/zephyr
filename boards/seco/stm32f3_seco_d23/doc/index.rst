##########################################

Overview
********

SBC-3.5-PX30 (JUNO - D23) is a Single Board Computer based on embedded Rockchip PX30
Processor, featuring Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A35 processor. The processor
integrates a Mali-G31 GPU with High performance dedicated 2D processor,
supporting OpenGL ES 1.1 / 2.0 / 3.2, Vulkan 1.0, OpenCL 2.0 and Open VG 1.1.
Embedded VPU is able to support video decoding of the most common coding
standard (MPEG-4, H.265/HEVC, H.264, VP8, VC-1). The board is completed with up
to 4GB LPDDR4-3200 32-bit bus memory directly soldered on board and one eMMC
5.1 Flash Drive with up to 64GB of capacity. LVDS Single Channel interface and
HDMI are supported. The RMII interface and Micrel KSZ8091 Ethernet Transceiver
allow the implementation of a Fast Ethernet interface. The networking
capabilities can be extended by WiFi+BT M.2 module and external modem module.
The audio functionalities are managed by the AudioCodec embedded in the RK-809
PMIC. SBC-3.5-PX30 board is completed by a series of connectors with various
interfaces (UART, SPI, I2C) managed by the microcontroller STM32F302VCT6.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Flashing
========

Applications for the ``stm32f3_seco_d23`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing an application to SECO SBC-3.5-PX30
--------------------------------------------

First, connect the SECO SBC-3.5-PX30 to your host computer using
CN56 connector to an ST-Link.

The pinout is (1-8):

- VDD
- UART1_TX
- UART1_RX
- BOOT_0
- SWDIO_JTMS
- SWCLK_JTCK
- EC_RST#
- GND

Then build and flash your application.

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: stm32f3_seco_d23
   :goals: build flash

Run a serial host program to connect with your board.

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/<tty device>

Replace <tty_device> with the port where the SBC-3.5-PX30 board can be
found.

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! stm32f3_seco_d23
