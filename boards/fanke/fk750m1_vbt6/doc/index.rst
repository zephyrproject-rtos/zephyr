Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

Pin Mapping
===========

FK750M1-VBT6 board has 5 GPIO controllers. These controllers are responsible for pin muxing,
input/output, pull-up, etc.

Default Zephyr Peripheral Mapping:
----------------------------------

The FK750M1-VBT6 board is configured as follows

- UART_1 TX/RX : PA9/PA10 (available on the header pins)
- User LED (blue) : PC13
- SPI4 NCS/CLK/MOSI : PE11/PE12/PE14 (SPI LCD)
- QuadSPI NCS/CLK/IO0/IO1/IO2/IO3 : PB6/PB2/PD11/PD12/PE2/PD13 (NOR Flash)
- USB DM/DP : PA11/PA12

System Clock
============

The FK750M1-VBT6 System Clock could be driven by an internal or external oscillator,
as well as by the main PLL clock. By default the system clock is driven by the PLL clock at 480MHz,
driven by an 25MHz external crystal oscillator.

Serial Port
===========

The Zephyr console output is assigned to UART1. The default communication settings are 115200 8N1.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``fk750m1_vbt6`` board target can be built and flashed in the usual
way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and :ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

The FK750M1-VBT6 board does not include an on-board debugger. As a result, it requires
an external debugger, such as ST-Link, for programming and debugging purposes.

The board provides header pins for the Serial Wire Debug (SWD) interface.

Flashing an application to FK750M1-VBT6
---------------------------------------

To begin, connect the ST-Link Debug Programmer to the FK750M1-VBT6 board using the SWD
interface. Next, connect the ST-Link to your host computer via a USB port.
Once this setup is complete, you can proceed to build and flash your application to the board

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: fk750m1_vbt6
   :goals: build flash

Run a serial host program to connect with your board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200

Then, press the RESET button, you should see the following message:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! fk750m1_vbt6

Debugging
=========

This current Zephyr port does not support debugging.
