Programming
***********

The Qomu platform by default boots from flash.

Below are steps to run Qomu sample application:

#. Build the sample in an usual way:

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/boards/qomu
      :board: qomu
      :goals: build

#. Remove Qomu board from USB port.
#. Insert Qomu board to USB port.
#. While the blue LED is blinking (for 5 seconds), touch the touch-pads with your finger.
   On success, the green led will start flashing.
#. Use TinyFpgaProgrammer application to load the target application:

   .. code-block:: console

      python3 /path/to/TinyFPGA-Programmer-Application/tinyfpga-programmer-gui.py --mode m4 --m4app build/zephyr/zephyr.bin --reset

   Refer to `TinyFPGA Programmer Application repo`_ for detailed information on installation
   and program usage.
