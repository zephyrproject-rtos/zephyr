menu "General Setup"
config  EXPERIMENTAL
	bool
	prompt "Experimental Options"
	default n
	help
	This option enables all experimental options in the project.
	If it is disabled, all options marked as EXPERIMENTAL will
	be disabled.
	If it is enabled, all options marked as EXPERIMENTAL will
	be available for selection.
config CROSS_COMPILE
	string "Cross-compiler tool prefix"
	help
	Same as running 'make CROSS_COMPILE=prefix-' but stored for
	default make runs in this kernel build directory.  You don't
	need to set this unless you want the configured kernel build
	directory to select the cross-compiler automatically.


menu "Compile and Link Features"


config  KERNEL_BIN_NAME
	string "The kernel binary name"
	default "microkernel" if MICROKERNEL
	default "nanokernel" if NANOKERNEL

config  DEBUG
	bool "Build kernel with debugging"
	default n
	help
	Build a kernel suitable for debugging.  Right now, this option
	only disables optimization, more debugging variants can be selected
	from here to allow more debugging.

config  COMPILER_OPT
	string
	prompt "Custom compiler options"
	default ""
	help
	This option is a free-form string that is passed to the compiler
	when building all parts of a project (i.e. kernel, LKMs, and USAPs).
	The compiler options specified by this string supplement the
	pre-defined set of compiler supplied by the build system,
	and can be used to change compiler optimization, warning and error
	messages, and so on.

	A given LKM or USAP can override this setting by means of the
	OVERRIDE_COMPILER_OPT make variable in its Makefile.

config TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT
	string "Cross-compiler variant name"
	help
	For optimized compilers with reduced features, specify the name
	of the variant.

config MINIMAL_LIBC
	bool
	prompt "Build minimal c library"
	default y
	depends on !NEWLIB
	help
	Build integrated minimal c library.

config TOOLCHAIN_NEWLIB
	bool
	prompt "Build with newlib c library"
	depends on !MINIMAL_LIBC
	default n
	help
	Build with newlib library. The newlib library is expected to be
	part of the SDK in this case.
endmenu
endmenu

menu "Debugging Options"

config PRINTK
	bool
	prompt "Send printk() to console"
	default y
	help
	This option directs printk() debugging output to the supported
	console device (UART), rather than suppressing the generation
	of printk() output entirely. Output is sent immediately, without
	any mutual exclusion or buffering.

config STDOUT_CONSOLE
	bool
	prompt "Send stdout to console"
	default n
	help
	This option directs standard output (e.g. printf) to the console
	device, rather than suppressing in entirely.

config ASSERT
	bool
	prompt "Enable __ASSERT() macro"
	default n
	help
	This enables the __ASSERT() macro in the kernel code. If an assertion
	fails, the calling thread is put on an infinite tight loop. Since
	enabling this adds a significant footprint, it should only be enabled
	in a non-production system.

config ASSERT_LEVEL
	int
	prompt "__ASSERT() level"
	default 1
	depends on ASSERT
	help
	This option specifies the assertion level used by the __ASSERT()
	macro. It can be set to one of three possible values:

	Level 0: off
	Level 1: on + warning in every file that includes __assert.h
	Level 2: on + no warning

endmenu


menu "Boot Options"

config BOOTLOADER_KEXEC
	bool
	prompt "Boot using Linux kexec() system call"
	depends on X86_32
	default n
	help
	This option signifies that Linux boots the kernel using kexec system call
	and utility. This method is used to boot the kernel over the network.

config BOOTLOADER_UNKNOWN
	bool
	default n
	help
	This option signifies that the target has an unknown bootloader
	or that it supports multiple ways of booting and it isn't clear
	at build time which method is to be used. When this option is enabled
	the platform may have to do extra work to ensure a proper startup.

config PROT_MODE_SWITCH
	bool
	prompt "Switch to 32-bit protected mode when booting"
	default n
	depends on X86_32
	help
	This option causes the kernel to transition from real mode (16-bit)
	to protected mode (32-bit) during its initial booting sequence.

config BOOT_A20_ENABLE
	bool "Boot A20 enable"
	depends on PROT_MODE_SWITCH
	default n
	help
	This option causes the A20 line to be enabled during the transition
	from real mode (16-bit) to protected mode (32-bit) during its initial
	booting sequence.

endmenu

menu "System Monitoring Options"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL

config  PERFORMANCE_METRICS
	bool
	prompt "Enable performance metrics"
	default n
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	Enable Performance Metrics.

config  BOOT_TIME_MEASUREMENT
	bool
	prompt "Boot time measurements [EXPERIMENTAL]"
	default n
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && PERFORMANCE_METRICS
	help
	This option enables the recording of timestamps during system start
	up. The global variable __start_tsc records the time kernel begins
	executing, while __main_tsc records when main() begins executing,
	and __idle_tsc records when the CPU becomes idle. All values are
	recorded in terms of CPU clock cycles since system reset.

config  CPU_CLOCK_FREQ_MHZ
	int
	prompt "CPU CLock Frequency in MHz"
	default 20
	depends on BOOT_TIME_MEASUREMENT
	help
	This option specifies the CPU Clock Frequency in MHz in order to
	convert Intel RDTSC timestamp to microseconds.
