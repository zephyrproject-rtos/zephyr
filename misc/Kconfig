config KERNEL_BIN_NAME
	string "The kernel binary name"
	default "zephyr"
	help
	This option sets the name of the generated kernel binary.

config TEXT_SECTION_OFFSET
	hex "TEXT section offset"
	default 0
	help
	This sets and offset before the text section and allows booting images
	with custom headers that are inserted at the beginning of the image.

config HAVE_CUSTOM_LINKER_SCRIPT
	prompt "Custom linker scripts provided"
	def_bool n
	help
	Set this option if you have a custom linker script which needed to
	be define in CUSTOM_LINKER_SCRIPT.

config CUSTOM_LINKER_SCRIPT
	string "Path to custom linker script"
	default ""
	depends on HAVE_CUSTOM_LINKER_SCRIPT
	help
	Path to the linker script to be used instead of the one define by the
	board.

	The linker script must be based on a version provided by Zephyr since
	the kernel can expect a certain layout/certain regions.

	This is useful when an application needs to add sections into the
	linker script and avoid having to change the script provided by
	Zephyr.

config CROSS_COMPILE
	string "Cross-compiler tool prefix"
	help
	Same as running 'make CROSS_COMPILE=prefix-' but stored for
	default make runs in this kernel build directory.  You don't
	need to set this unless you want the configured kernel build
	directory to select the cross-compiler automatically.

config GDB_INFO
	bool
	prompt "Task-aware debugging with GDB"
	default n
	help
	  This option enables the kernel to collect additional information
	  during interrupts, exceptions, and context switches. This information
	  is required for task-aware debugging with GDB.

config LINK_WHOLE_ARCHIVE
	bool "Allow linking with --whole-archive"
	default n
	help
	This options allows linking external libraries with the
	--whole-archive option to keep all symbols.

config COMPILER_OPT
	string
	prompt "Custom compiler options"
	default ""
	help
	This option is a free-form string that is passed to the compiler
	when building all parts of a project (i.e. kernel).
	The compiler options specified by this string supplement the
	pre-defined set of compiler supplied by the build system,
	and can be used to change compiler optimization, warning and error
	messages, and so on.

config TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT
	string "Cross-compiler variant name"
	help
	For optimized compilers with reduced features, specify the name
	of the variant.

config CPLUSPLUS
	bool "Enable C++ support for the application"
	default n
	help
	This option enables the use of applications built with C++.

prompt "C Library"
default MINIMAL_LIBC

config MINIMAL_LIBC
	bool
	prompt "Build minimal c library"
	help
	Build integrated minimal c library. This integrated library is available
	to support kernel functionality and test cases. It is not designed to be
	used with applications. For applications, please use an external C
	library such as newlib.

config NEWLIB_LIBC
	bool
	prompt "Build with newlib c library"
	help
	Build with newlib library. The newlib library is expected to be
	part of the SDK in this case.

endchoice

config NEWLIB_LIBC_FLOAT_PRINTF
	bool "Build with newlib float printf"
	default n
	depends on NEWLIB_LIBC
	help
	Build with floating point printf enabled. This will increase the size of
	the image.

config NEWLIB_LIBC_FLOAT_SCANF
	bool "Build with newlib float scanf"
	default n
	depends on NEWLIB_LIBC
	help
	Build with floating point scanf enabled. This will increase the size of
	the image.

config MINIMAL_LIBC_EXTENDED
	bool "Build additional libc functions [EXPERIMENTAL]"
	default n
	depends on MINIMAL_LIBC
	help
	This option enables building some optional libc functions that
	are not used directly by the kernel but can be used in applications.
	The option adds the following functions: strtoul, strtol, atoi,
	strncasecmp.
	Warning: Use the above functions only for testing, if you need to
	use any of the functions in an application you probably should be
	linking against a full lib c implementation instead.

menu "Debugging Options"

config DEBUG
	bool "Build kernel with debugging enabled"
	default n
	help
	Build a kernel suitable for debugging.  Right now, this option
	only disables optimization, more debugging variants can be selected
	from here to allow more debugging.

config TASK_DEBUG
	bool
	prompt "Task debugging [EXPERIMENTAL]"
	default n
	help
	This option allows execution of all tasks (with the exception of
	essential system tasks) to be suspended so that debugging operations
	can be performed.

config STACK_USAGE
	bool "Generate stack usage information"
	default n
	help
	Generate  an extra file that specifies the maximum amount of stack used,
	on a per-function basis.

config PRINTK
	bool
	prompt "Send printk() to console"
	depends on CONSOLE_HAS_DRIVER
	default y
	help
	This option directs printk() debugging output to the supported
	console device, rather than suppressing the generation
	of printk() output entirely. Output is sent immediately, without
	any mutual exclusion or buffering.

config STDOUT_CONSOLE
	bool
	prompt "Send stdout to console"
	depends on CONSOLE_HAS_DRIVER
	default n
	help
	This option directs standard output (e.g. printf) to the console
	device, rather than suppressing it entirely.

config EARLY_CONSOLE
	bool
	prompt "Send stdout at the earliest stage possible"
	default n
	help
	This option will enable stdout as early as possible, for debugging
	purpose. For instance, in case of STDOUT_CONSOLE being set it will
	initialize its driver earlier than normal, in order to get the stdout
	sent through the console at the earliest stage possible.

config ASSERT
	bool
	prompt "Enable __ASSERT() macro"
	default n
	help
	This enables the __ASSERT() macro in the kernel code. If an assertion
	fails, the calling thread is put on an infinite tight loop. Since
	enabling this adds a significant footprint, it should only be enabled
	in a non-production system.

config ASSERT_LEVEL
	int
	prompt "__ASSERT() level"
	default 2
	range 0 2
	depends on ASSERT
	help
	This option specifies the assertion level used by the __ASSERT()
	macro. It can be set to one of three possible values:

	Level 0: off
	Level 1: on + warning in every file that includes __assert.h
	Level 2: on + no warning

config DEBUG_TRACING_KERNEL_OBJECTS
	bool
	prompt "Debug tracing object"
	default n
	help
	This option enable the feature for tracing kernel objects. This option
	is for debug purposes and increase the memory footprint of the kernel.

config OMIT_FRAME_POINTER
	bool
	prompt "Omit frame pointer"
	default n
	help
	Prevent the compiler from putting the stack frame pointer into a
	register. Saves a few instructions in function prologues/epilogues and
	frees up a register for general-purpose use, which can provide good
	performance improvements on register-constrained architectures like
	x86. Omitting frame pointers impedes debugging as local variables are
	harder to locate and it is much more difficult to produce a stack
	trace. Recommended only for production builds which do not need to be
	debugged.

config SYS_LOG_OVERRIDE_LEVEL
	int
	prompt "Override lowest log level"
	depends on SYS_LOG
	default 0
	range 0 4
	help
	  Forces a minimum log level for all modules. Modules use their
	  specified level if it is greater than this option, otherwise they use
	  the level specified by this option instead of their default or
	  whatever was manually set.
	  Levels are:
	  0 OFF, do not override
	  1 ERROR, override to write SYS_LOG_ERR
