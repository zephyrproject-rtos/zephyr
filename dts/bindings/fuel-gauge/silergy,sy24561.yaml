  SY24561 is a simple gas gauge IC for single cell lithium-ion (Li+) batteries in handheld
  and portable equipment.

  SY24561 senses battery terminal voltage and use the proprietary algorithm to calculate the
  corresponding State of Charge (SOC). Comparing with conventional voltage-based gauge which
  translates terminal voltage directly to SOC, the advanced algorithm in SY24561 shows great
  advantage in SOC accuracy. SY24561 can be classified as advanced voltage-based gauge without
  current sensor and the SOC accuracy will not degrade with time. Temperature of the battery
  pack is measured by the host microcontroller and feed to SY24561 through the I2C interface.
  SY24561 can automatically compensate temperature, load variation and battery age.
