  ON Semiconductor LC709203F fuel gauge. For more info visit
  https://www.onsemi.com/products/power-management/battery-management/battery-fuel-gauges/LC709204F

compatible: "onnn,lc709203f"

include: [i2c-device.yaml, fuel-gauge.yaml]

properties:
  initial-rsoc:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      The LSI can be forced to initialize RSOC by sending the he Initial RSOC Command.
      The LSI initializes RSOC by the measured voltage at that time when the Initial
      RSOC command is written

  apa:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: |
      Adjustment Pack Application: Value for a battery type to improve the RSOC precision.
      Typical values are provided and should be selected approximately.
    enum:
      - "100mAh"
      - "200mAh"
      - "500mAh"
      - "1000mAh"
      - "2000mAh"
      - "3000mAh"

  battery-profile:
    type: int
    description: |
      The LSI contains a data file comprised of two battery profiles.
      This register is used to select the battery profile to be used.
      Register Number of the Parameter (0x1A) contains identity of the data file.
      The Data file is loaded during final test depending on the part number ordered.
      To decide which battery-profile should be used please refer to the LC709203F data sheet.
    enum:
      - 0x0
      - 0x1

  thermistor:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Specifies if the device is used with a thermistor or not.

  thermistor-b-value:
    type: int
    description: |
      Sets B-constant of the thermistor to be measured. Refer to
      the specification sheet of the thermistor for the set value to used.
      The default is set to 0x0D34 which is the initial value of the IC.
      Note: This value will only be set if a thermistor is used.
    default: 0x0D34

  apt:
    type: int
    description: |
      This is used to compensate for the delay of the thermistor
      measurement caused by a capacitor across the thermistor.
      The default value has been found to meet most of circuits
      where a capacitor is not put. For details please refer to the
      LC709203F data sheet.
      Note: This value will only be set if a thermistor is used.
    default: 0x1E

  thermistor-mode:
    type: int
    description: |
      This selects the Thermistor mode.
      Thermistor mode (0x1): The LSI measures the attached thermistor and
      loads the temperature into the Cell Temperature register.
      I2C mode (0x0): the temperature is provided by the host processor.
      The default is set to 0x1, because if a thermistor is used, the
      thermistor mode should be selected.
      Note: This value will only be necessary if a thermistor is used,
      otherwise the initial value of the IC is 0x0 and setting is not necessary.
    enum:
      - 0x0
      - 0x1
    default: 0x1
