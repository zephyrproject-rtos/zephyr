  Composite fuel-gauge constructed from sensor devices

compatible: "zephyr,fuel-gauge-composite"

include: [fuel-gauge.yaml, battery.yaml]

properties:
  source-primary:
    type: phandle
    required: true
    description: |
      Primary device to read sensor data from.
      Device must implement the sensor API.

  source-secondary:
    type: phandle
    description: |
      Secondary device to read sensor data from.
      This device will be used if input-primary does not expose
      a channel.

      Device must implement the sensor API.

  fuel-gauge-channels:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Sources should be queried by the sensor API fuel gauge
      channels (SENSOR_CHAN_GAUGE_*), instead of the generic
      channels (SENSOR_CHAN_VOLTAGE, etc).
