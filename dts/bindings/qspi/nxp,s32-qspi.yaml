  NXP S32 Quad Serial Peripheral Interface (QSPI) Controller.

  QSPI acts as an interface to up to two serial flash memory devices, each with
  up to eight bidirectional bidirectional data lines, depending on the platform.

compatible: "nxp,s32-qspi"

include: [base.yaml, pinctrl-device.yaml]

bus: qspi

properties:
  reg:
    required: true

  "#address-cells":
    const: 1

  "#size-cells":
    const: 0

  data-rate:
    type: string
    enum:
      - SDR
      - DDR
    description: |
      Selects the read mode:
      - Single Data Rate (SDR): sampling of incoming data occurs on single edges.
      - Double Data Rate (DDR): sampling of incoming data occurs on both edges.

  hold-time-2x:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Set to align incoming data with 2x serial flash half clock, when in DDR
      mode. Otherwise, data will be aligned to the posedge of the controller's
      internal reference clock.

  sample-delay-half-cycle:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Set to use half-cycle early DQS delay when sampling received data.

  sample-phase-inverted:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Set to sample received data at inverted clock.

  cs-setup-time:
    type: int
    default: 3
    description: |
      Chip select setup time, in serial clock cycles. A bigger value will pull
      the CS signal earlier before the transaction starts.
      The default corresponds to the reset value of the register field.

  cs-hold-time:
    type: int
    default: 3
    description: |
      Chip select hold time, in serial clock cycles. A bigger value will release
      the CS signal later after the transaction ends.
      The default corresponds to the reset value of the register field.

  column-space:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Column Address Space bit width. For example, if the coulmn address is
      [2:0] of QSPI_SFAR/AHB address, then the column address space bit width
      must be 3. If there is no column address separation in any serial flash
      device connected to this controller, this value must be programmed to 0.
      The default corresponds to the reset value of the register field.

  word-addressable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Set if the serial flash device connected to this controller is word
      (2 bytes) addressable.

  byte-swapping:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      In case of Octal DDR mode, specifies whether a word unit composed of two
      bytes from posedge and negedge of a single DQS cycle needs to be swapped.

  ahb-buffers-masters:
    type: array
    description: |
      Masters ID's for the AHB receive buffers. The master ID of every incoming
      request is checked and the data is returned or fetched into the
      corresponding associated buffer. The maximum number of buffers is SoC
      specific.

  ahb-buffers-sizes:
    type: array
    description: |
      Sizes (in bytes) of the AHB receive buffers. The maximum buffer size and
      maximum number of buffers is SoC specific.

  ahb-buffers-all-masters:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Any access from a master not associated with any other buffer is routed to
      the last buffer.

  a-rx-clock-source:
    type: string
    enum:
      - LOOPBACK
      - LOOPBACK DQS
      - INTERNAL DQS
      - EXTERNAL DQS
    description: |
      Selects DQS clock source for sampling read data at side A:
      - LOOPBACK: use loopback clock from dummy internal PAD as strobe signal.
      - LOOPBACK DQS: use loopback clock from PAD as strobe signal.
      - INTERNAL DQS: use internally generated strobe signal.
      - EXTERNAL DQS: use external strobe signal.

  a-io2-idle-high:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Set if the logic level of IO2 signal output of this controller must be
      driven high in the inactive state.
      This property applies to side A of the controller.

  a-io3-idle-high:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Set if the logic level of IO3 signal output of this controller must be
      driven high in the inactive state.
      This property applies to side A of the controller.
