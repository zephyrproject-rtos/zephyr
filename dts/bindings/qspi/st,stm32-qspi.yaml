    STM32 QSPI Controller.

    An stm32 quadspi node would typically look like this:

        &quadspi {
            pinctrl-0 = <&quadspi_clk_pe10 &quadspi_ncs_pe11
                         &quadspi_bk1_io0_pe12 &quadspi_bk1_io1_pe13
                         &quadspi_bk1_io2_pe14 &quadspi_bk1_io3_pe15>;

            dmas = <&dma1 5 5 0x0000 0x03>;
            dma-names = "tx_rx";

            status = "okay";
        };

  pinctrl-0:
    required: true

  pinctrl-names:
    required: true

  dmas:
    description: |
      Optional DMA channel specifier. If DMA should be used, specifier should
      hold a phandle reference to the dma controller (not the DMAMUX even if present),
      the channel number, the slot number, channel configuration and finally features.
      (depending on the type of DMA: 'features' is optional)

      When a DMAMUX is present and enabled, the channel is the dma one
      (not dmamux channel). The request is given by the DMAMUX (no 'features' required).

      For example with DMA 2 for TX/RX on QSPI like stm32l496 (no 'features')
         /* select DMA2 channel 7 request 3 for QUADSPI */
         dmas = <&dma2 7 3 (STM32_DMA_PERIPH_TX | STM32_DMA_PRIORITY_HIGH)>;
      For example with a DMAMUX for TX/RX on QSPI like stm32wb55  (no 'features')
         /* select DMA2 channel 0, request 20 for QUADSPI */
         dmas = <&dma2 0 20 (STM32_DMA_PERIPH_TX | STM32_DMA_PRIORITY_HIGH)>;

  dma-names:
    description: |
      DMA channel name. If DMA should be used, expected value is "tx_rx".

      For example
         dma-names = "tx_rx";

  dual-flash:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      configuration to enable the dual flash mode of the QSPI peripheral
      where two external quad SPI Flash memories (FLASH 1 and FLASH 2) are used
      in order to send/receive 8 bits (or 16 bits in DDR mode) every cycle,
      effectively doubling the throughput as well as the capacity.
      When true, the Flash ID number <flash-id> is useless.

  flash-id:
    type: int
    description: |
      Flash ID number. This number, if defined, helps to select the right
      QSPI GPIO banks (defined as 'quadspi_bk[1/2]' in pinctrl property)
      to communicate with flash memory.
      Valid only if the <dual-flash> is not set.

      For example
         flash-id = <2>;
