    STM32 OSPI device representation. Enabling a stm32 octospi node in a board
    description would typically requires this:

        &octospi {
            pinctrl-0 = <&octospi_clk_pe9 &octospi_ncs_pe10 &octospi_dqs_pe11
                         &octospi_io0_pe12 &octospi_io1_pe13
                         &octospi_io2_pe14 &octospi_io3_pe15
                         &octospi_io4_pe16 &octospi_io5_pe17
                         &octospi_io6_pe18 &octospi_io7_pe19>;

            dmas = <&dma1 5 41 0x10000>;
            dma-names = "tx_rx";

            status = "okay";
        };

compatible: "st,stm32-ospi"

include: [base.yaml, pinctrl-device.yaml]

bus: ospi

properties:
  reg:
    required: true

  interrupts:
    required: true

  pinctrl-0:
    required: true

  pinctrl-names:
    required: true

  clock-names:
    required: true

  dmas:
    description: |
      Optional DMA channel specifier, required for DMA transactions.
      For example dmas for TX/RX on OSPI
         dmas = <&dma1 5 41 0x10000>;

      With, in each cell of the dmas specifier:
      - &dma1: dma controller phandle
      - 5: channel number (0 to Max-Channel minus 1). From 0 to 15 on stm32u5x.
      - 41: slot number (request which could be given by the DMAMUX)
      - 0x10000: channel configuration (only for srce/dest data size, priority)

      Notes:
        - On series supporting DMAMUX, the DMA phandle should be provided
          but DMAMUX node should also be enabled in the DTS.
        - For channel configuration, only the config bits priority and
          periph/mem datasize are used. The periph/mem datasize must be equal,
          0 is a correct value.
         - There is no Fifo used by this DMA peripheral.

      For example dmas for TX/RX on OSPI
         dmas = <&dma1 5 41 0x10000>;

  dma-names:
    description: |
      DMA channel name. If DMA should be used, expected value is "tx_rx".

      For example
         dma-names = "tx_rx";

  dlyb-bypass:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enables Delay Block (DLYB) Bypass.

  ssht-enable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enables Sample Shifting half-cycle.

      It is recommended to be enabled in STR mode and disabled in DTR mode.

  io-low-port:
    type: string
    enum:
      - "IOPORT_NONE"
      - "IOPORT_1_LOW"
      - "IOPORT_1_HIGH"
      - "IOPORT_2_LOW"
      - "IOPORT_2_HIGH"
    description: |
      Specifies which port of the OCTOSPI IO Manager is used for the IO[3:0] pins.

      If absent, then `IOPORT_<n>_LOW` is used where `n` is the OSPI
      instance number.

      Note: You might need to enable the OCTOSPI I/O manager clock to use the
            property. Please refer to Reference Manual.
            The clock can be enabled in the devicetree.

  io-high-port:
    type: string
    enum:
      - "IOPORT_NONE"
      - "IOPORT_1_LOW"
      - "IOPORT_1_HIGH"
      - "IOPORT_2_LOW"
      - "IOPORT_2_HIGH"
    description: |
      Specifies which port of the OCTOSPI IO Manager is used for the IO[7:4] pins.

      If absent, then `IOPORT_<n>_HIGH` is used where `n` is the OSPI
      instance number.

      Can be set to `IOPORT_NONE` for Single SPI, Dual SPI and Quad SPI.

      Note: You might need to enable the OCTOSPI I/O manager clock to use the
            property. Please refer to Reference Manual.
            The clock can be enabled in the devicetree.
