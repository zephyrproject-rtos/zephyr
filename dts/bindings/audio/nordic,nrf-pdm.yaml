    description: |
      Clock source to be used by the PDM peripheral. The following options
      are available:
      - "PCLK32M": 32 MHz peripheral clock, synchronous to HFCLK
      - "PCLK32M_HFXO": PCLK32M running off the 32 MHz crystal oscillator
        (HFXO) for better clock accuracy and jitter performance
      - "ACLK": Audio PLL clock with configurable frequency (frequency for
        this clock must be set via the "hfclkaudio-frequency" property
        in the "nordic,nrf-clock" node); this clock source is only available
        in the nRF53 Series SoCs and it requires the use of HFXO
    enum:
      - "PCLK32M"
      - "PCLK32M_HFXO"
      - "ACLK"

  queue-size:

    description: |
      Size of the queue of received audio data blocks to be used
      by the driver.
