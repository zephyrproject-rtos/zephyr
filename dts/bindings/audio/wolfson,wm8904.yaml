      Codec's internal clock signal (SYSCLK) source selection. These options
      are available:
      - "MCLK": WM8904's MCLK pin (supplied by the host)
      - "FLL":  WM8904's FLL facility, can be free-running
      The "MCLK" option is default, as this clock signal is usually supplied
      by the host.
    enum:
      - "MCLK"
      - "FLL"
  fs-ratio:
    type: int
    default: 256
    enum: [64, 128, 192, 256, 384, 512, 768, 1024, 1408, 1536]
    description: |
      This property is intended for platforms where the MCLK frequency is
      not directly available to the driver.
      On such platforms, the driver assumes the MCLK frequency to be equal
      to (fs-ratio * <sample rate>), where the sample rate comes from the
      audio codec configuration provided at runtime.
