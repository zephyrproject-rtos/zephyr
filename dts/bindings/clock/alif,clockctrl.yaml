  Alif Semiconductor clock controller

  This binding describes the clock controller for Alif Semiconductor SoCs
  that manages clocks for various peripherals.

  The clock controller requires 7 register regions to control different
  aspects of the clock tree:
  - cgu: Clock Generation Unit
  - clkctl_per_mst: Peripheral clock control (Master)
  - clkctl_per_slv: Peripheral clock control (Slave)
  - aon: Always-on domain
  - vbat: Vbat domain
  - m55he_cfg: Cortex-M55 HE cluster configuration
  - m55hp_cfg: Cortex-M55 HP cluster configuration

  Example usage in a peripheral node:
    uart0: uart@... {
        clocks = <&clockctrl ALIF_UART0_SYST_PCLK>;
    };

      Clock controller register regions. 7 regions are required in the
      following order: cgu, clkctl_per_mst, clkctl_per_slv, aon, vbat,
      m55he_cfg, m55hp_cfg

      Names for the register regions. Each name corresponds to a clock
      control module and is used by the driver to locate the appropriate
      register base address. See the description above for valid names.
