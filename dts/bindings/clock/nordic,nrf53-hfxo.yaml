compatible: "nordic,nrf53-hfxo"

include: fixed-clock.yaml

properties:
  clock-frequency:
    const: 32000000

  startup-time-us:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Startup time in microseconds.

      The value can be obtained by first measuring the time between
      TASKS_HFCLKSTART and EVENTS_HFCLKSTARTED. Then multiply
      the value by 2 to account for temperature and supply variations.

      Note that the startup time will be longer usual on the first
      power-up and as such should not be used to determine
      startup-time-us.

  load-capacitors:
    type: string
    enum:
      - "internal"
      - "external"
    description: |
      Type of load capacitors connected to the crystal.
