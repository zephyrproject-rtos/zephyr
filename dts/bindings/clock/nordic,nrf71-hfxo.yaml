      Startup time in microseconds.

      The value can be obtained by first measuring the time between
      TASKS_XOSTART and EVENTS_STARTED. Then multiply the value by 2 to
      account for temperature and supply variations.

      Note that the startup time will be longer than usual on the first
      power-up and as such should not be used to determine
      startup-time-us.
