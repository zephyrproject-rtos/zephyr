  STM32MP2 RCC (Reset and Clock controller).

  On STM32MP2 platforms, the clock tree is configured by the Cortex-A35 core.
  As a consequence, the only property to be set in devicetree node is the
  clock-frequency.

  As for the peripherals, the clocks are configured per peripheral in the
  corresponding device tree node. The clock controller is responsible for
  enabling/disabling the clocks for the peripherals, when allowed by the
  Resource Isolation Framework(RIF) peripheral, configured by the cortex-A35
  core.

  To declare a peripheral "PERx" clock in the dtsi, you can follow the example
  below:
    PERx {
      ...
      clocks = <&rcc STM32_CLOCK(PERx, STM32_CLK)>;
      ...
    };
