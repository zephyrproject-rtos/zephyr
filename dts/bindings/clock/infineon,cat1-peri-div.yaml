properties:
  clk-dst:
    type: uint8-array
    description: |
      Clock Connections. PDL uses the target IP to identify the peri group

  div-type:
    type: int
    description: |
      Clock divider type.

  div-num:
    type: int
    description: |
     Programmable clock divider types: DIV_8_BIT, DIV_16_BIT, DIV_16_5_BIT, DIV_24_5_BIT

  div-value:
    type: int
    description: |
      For non-fractional clock dividers (div-type: DIV_8_BIT, DIV_16_BIT)
      Causes integer division of (divider value + 1), or division by 1 to 256
      (8-bit divider) or 1 to 65536 (16-bit divider).

      For fractional clock dividers (div-type: DIV_16_5_BIT, DIV_24_5_BIT):
      The integer divider value. The source of the divider is peri_clk, which is a
      divided version of hf_clk[0]. The divider value causes integer division of
      (divider value + 1), or division by 1 to 65536 (16-bit divider) or 1 to 16777216
      (24-bit divider).

  div-frac-value:
    type: int
    description: |
      The fraction part of the divider. The fractional divider can be 0-31, thus
      it divides the clock by 1/32 for each count. To divide the clock by 11/32nds
      set this value to 11.

  scb-block:
    type: int
    required: true

      SCB device instance peripheral clock is assigned to:
      &scb0 : scb-block = <0>
      &scb3 : scb-block = <3>
      &scb5 : scb-block = <5>
