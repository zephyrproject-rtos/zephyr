  PLL node binding for STM32MP13 devices

  It can be used to describe 4 different PLLs: PLL1, PLL2, PLL3 and PLL4.

  These PLLs can take one of hse_ck, hsi_ck or csi_ck as input clock.
  PLLM factor is used to set the input clock in this acceptable range.

  Each PLL has one output clock whose frequency can be computed with the
  following formula:

    f(PLL_P) = f(VCO clock) / (DIVP × DIVR × DIVQ)

      with f(VCO clock) = f(PLL clock input) × 2 × (((DIVN + 1) + (FRACV / 8192)) / DIVM1)

  Note: To reduce the power consumption, it is recommended to configure the VCOx
        clock output to the lowest frequency.

  The PLL1 output frequency must not exceed 2000 MHz.
  The PLL2 output frequency must not exceed 1600 MHz.
  The PLL3 output frequency must not exceed 800 MHz.
  The PLL4 output frequency must not exceed 800 MHz.

  Note: The CPU clock should not exceed 1Ghz so avoid configuring the PLL1 to more
  than 1000 MHz or program the mpuss_ck mux to use the MPUDIV
  (refer to the stm32mp13 reference manual for details)
