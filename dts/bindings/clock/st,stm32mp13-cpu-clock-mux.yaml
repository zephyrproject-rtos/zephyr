  STM32MP13 CPU Clock
  Describes the STM32MP13 CPU armv7 timer multiplexer.
  For the STM32MP13 the CPU armv7 timer input can either be the HSI or the HSE.
  For instance:
  cpusw: cpusw {
    #clock-cells = <0>;
    clocks = <&clk_hsi>;
    clock-frequency = <DT_FREQ_M(64)>;
    compatible = "st,stm32mp13-cpu-clock-mux", "st,stm32-clock-mux";
    status = "okay";
  };

compatible: "st,stm32mp13-cpu-clock-mux"

include:
  - name: base.yaml
    property-allowlist:
      - status
      - compatible
      - clocks

properties:
  clock-frequency:
    required: true
    type: int
