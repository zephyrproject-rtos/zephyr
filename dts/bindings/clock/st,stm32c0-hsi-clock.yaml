  STM32 HSI Clock node description for STM32C0 devices
  On STM32C0, HSI is a 48MHz fixed clock.

  It also produces a HSISYS secondary clk which can be used as system clock
  source. In that case, a HSI divisor (ranges from 1 to 128) can be applied:
  SYSCLK = HSI48 / HSI DIV
        enum:
        - 1 ==> HSISYS = 48MHZ
        - 2 ==> HSISYS = 24MHZ
        - 4 ==> HSISYS = 12MHZ
        - 8 ==> HSISYS = 6MHZ
        - 16 ==> HSISYS = 3MHZ
        - 32 ==> HSISYS = 1.5MHz
        - 64 ==> HSISYS = 0.75MHZ
        - 128 ==> HSISYS = 0.375MHz
