  AT32 Clock and Reset controller node.
  This node is in charge of system clock ('SYSCLK') source selection and controlling
  clocks for AHB (Advanced High Performance) and APB (Advanced Peripheral) bus domains.

  Configuring AT32 Clock and Reset controller node:

  System clock source should be selected amongst the clock nodes available in "clocks"
  node (typically 'clk_hext, clk_hick', 'pll', ...).
  Core clock frequency should also be defined, using "clock-frequency" property.
  Note:
          Core clock frequency  = SYSCLK / AHB prescaler
  Last, peripheral bus clocks (typically PCLK1, PCLK2) should be configured using matching
  prescaler properties.
  Here is an example of correctly configured rcc node:
  &rcc {
           clocks = <&pll>;  /* Select 80MHz pll as SYSCLK source */
           ahb-prescaler = <2>;
           clock-frequency = <DT_FREQ_M(40)>; /* = SYSCLK / AHB prescaler */
           apb1-presacler = <1>;
           apb2-presacler = <1>;
  }

    description: |
      On some parts, it could be required to set up highest core frequencies
      (>80MHz) in two steps in order to prevent undershoot.
      This is done by applying an intermediate AHB prescaler before switching
      System Clock source to PLL. Once done, prescaler is set back to expected
      value.
