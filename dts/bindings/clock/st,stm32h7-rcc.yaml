  STM32H7 RCC (Reset and Clock controller).

  This node is in charge of system clock ('SYSCLK') source selection and
  System Clock Generation.

  Configuring STM32 Reset and Clock controller node:

  System clock source should be selected amongst the clock nodes available in "clocks"
  node (typically 'clk_hse, clk_csi', 'pll', ...).
  As part of this node configuration, SYSCLK frequency should also be defined, using
  "clock-frequency" property.
  Last, bus clocks (typically HCLK, PCLK1, PCLK2) should be configured using matching
  prescaler properties.
  Here is an example of correctly configured rcc node:
  &rcc {
           clocks = <&pll>;  /* Set pll as SYSCLK source */
           clock-frequency = <DT_FREQ_M(480)>; /* SYSCLK runs at 480MHz */
           d1cpre = <1>;
           hpre = <1>;
           d1ppre = <1>;
           d2ppre1 = <1>;
           d2ppre2 = <1>;
           d3ppre = <1>;
  }

        D1 Domain, CPU1 clock prescaler. Sets a HCLK frequency (feeding Cortex-M Systick)
        lower than SYSCLK frequency (actual core frequency).
        Zephyr doesn't make a difference today between these two clocks.
        Changing this prescaler is not allowed until it is made possible to
        use them independently in Zephyr clock subsystem.
