  STM32H7 RCC (Reset and Clock controller).

  This node is in charge of system clock ('SYSCLK') source selection and
  System Clock Generation.

  Configuring STM32 Reset and Clock controller node:

  System clock source should be selected amongst the clock nodes available in "clocks"
  node (typically 'clk_hse, clk_csi', 'pll', ...).
  As part of this node configuration, SYSCLK frequency should also be defined, using
  "clock-frequency" property.
  Last, bus clocks (typically HCLK, PCLK1, PCLK2) should be configured using matching
  prescaler properties.
  Here is an example of correctly configured rcc node:
  &rcc {
           clocks = <&pll>;  /* Set pll as SYSCLK source */
           clock-frequency = <DT_FREQ_M(480)>; /* SYSCLK runs at 480MHz */
           d1cpre = <1>;
           hpre = <1>;
           d1ppre = <1>;
           d2ppre1 = <1>;
           d2ppre2 = <1>;
           d3ppre = <1>;
  }

        D1 Domain, CPU1 clock prescaler. Sets a HCLK frequency (feeding Cortex-M Systick)
        lower than SYSCLK frequency (actual core frequency).
        Zephyr doesn't make a difference today between these two clocks.
        Changing this prescaler is not allowed until it is made possible to
        use them independently in Zephyr clock subsystem.

        Used to control the clock frequency of all the timers connected to APB1 and APB2 domain.
        - When absent: If the APB prescaler (D2PPRE1, D2PPRE2 in the RCC_D2CFGR register) is
          configured to a division factor of 1, TIMxCLK = HCKL. Otherwise, the timer clock
          frequencies are set to twice to the frequency of the APB domain to which the timers are
          connected: TIMxCLK = 2xPCLKx.
        - When present: If the APB prescaler (D2PPRE1, D2PPRE2 in the RCC_D2CFGR register) is
          configured to a division factor of 1 or 2, TIMxCLK = HCKL. Otherwise, the timer clock
          frequencies are set to four times to the frequency of the APB domain to which the timers
          are connected: TIMxCLK = 4xPCLKx.
