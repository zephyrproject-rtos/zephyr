  STM32L0/L1 Main PLL.

  Takes one of clk_hse, clk_hsi or clk_msi as input clock, with an
  input frequency from 2 to 24 MHz.

  The desired PLL frequency can be computed with the following formula:

    f(PLL) = f(VCO clock) / PLLDIV  --> PLLCLK (System Clock)

      with f(VCO clock) = f(PLL clock input) Ã— PLLMUL --> PLLVCO

  The PLL output frequency must not exceed 32 MHz.

        PLL multiplication factor for VCO
        The PLL VCO clock frequency must not exceed:
        - 96 MHz when the product is in Range 1
        - 48 MHz when the product is in Range 2
        - 24 MHz when the product is in Range 3
        If the USB uses the PLL as clock source, the PLL VCO clock must be
        programmed to output a 96 MHz frequency (USBCLK = PLLVCO/2).
