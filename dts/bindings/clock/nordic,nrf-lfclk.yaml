  nRF LFCLK (Low Frequency CLocK)

  The LFCLK can use the following clocks as clock sources:

    - HFXO: The HFXO clock is used as a clock source if the
      LFCLK SYNTH mode is selected and the LFXO clock is not
      available. The HFXO clock is used indirectly through
      the FLL16M clock in BYPASS mode.

    - LFXO: The LFXO clock is used as a clock source if the
      LFCLK SYNTH mode is selected and the LFXO clock is
      available. The LFXO clock is used indirectly through
      the FLL16M clock in BYPASS mode.

  Devicetree example:

    lfclk {
            lfrc-accuracy-ppm = <500>;
            lflprc-accuracy-ppm = <1000>;
            lfrc-startup-time-us = <400>;
            lflprc-startup-time-us = <400>;
            clocks = <&hfxo>, <&lfxo>;
            clock-names = "hfxo", "lfxo";
    };
