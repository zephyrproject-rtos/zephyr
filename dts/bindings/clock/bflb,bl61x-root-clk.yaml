  The BL61x Root Clock
  Represents both FCLK and HCLK, which should be kept the same.
  Source -> FCLK / divider -> HCLK / divider -> BCLK

  'clocks' take the form of:
  clocks = <&clk_wifipll BL61X_WIFIPLL_320MHz>;
  Where the phandle is one of clk_wifipll, clk_aupll (Unsupported), clk_crystal, or clk_rc32m.
  The second argument is from include/zephyr/dt-bindings/clock/bflb_bl61x_clock.h
