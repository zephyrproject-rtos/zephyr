  Nordic FLL16M

  The FLL16M can use the following clocks as clock sources:

    - HFXO: The HFXO clock is used as a clock source if the
      FLL16M mode is BYPASS, or if the FLL16M mode is
      closed-loop and the LFXO clock is not available.

    - LFXO: The LFXO clock is used as a clock source if the
      FLL16M mode is closed-loop and the LFXO clock is
      available.

  Devicetree example:

    fll16m {
            open-loop-accuracy-ppm = <20000>;
            closed-loop-base-accuracy-ppm = <5000>;
            clocks = <&hfxo>, <&lfxo>;
            clock-names = "hfxo", "lfxo";
    };

  closed-loop-base-accuracy-ppm:
    type: int
    description: |
      Base clock accuracy in parts per million if closed-loop clock source is used.
      The actual accuracy is this property plus the accuracy of the HFXO or LFXO.
