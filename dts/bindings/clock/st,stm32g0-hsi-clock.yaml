  STM32G0 HSI Clock.

  On STM32G0, HSI is a 16MHz fixed clock.

  It also produces a HSISYS secondary clk which can be used as system clock
  source. In that case, a HSI divisor (ranges from 1 to 128) can be applied:
  SYSCLK = HSI16 / HSI DIV
        enum:
        - 1 ==> HSISYS = 16MHZ
        - 2 ==> HSISYS = 8MHZ
        - 4 ==> HSISYS = 4MHZ
        - 8 ==> HSISYS = 2MHZ
        - 16 ==> HSISYS = 1MHZ
        - 32 ==> HSISYS = 0.5MHz
        - 64 ==> HSISYS = 0.25MHZ
        - 128 ==> HSISYS = 0.125MHz
