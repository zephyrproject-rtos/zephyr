        STM32F1 Microcontroller Clock Output (MCO)

        The STM32F1 MCO is similar to other series but has no configurable
        prescaler before the output. However, note that certain inputs of
        the MCO are fitted with a fixed prescaler, making it possible to
        output a slowed down variation of certain clocks.

        Example:
                &mco1 {
                        clocks = <&rcc STM32_SRC_LSE MCO1_SEL(7)>;
                        pinctrl-0 = <&rcc_mco_pa8>;
                        pinctrl-names = "default";
                        status = "okay";
                };

        Note: in the `clocks` property, the domain clock source cell should
        use the value representing the base clock, regardless of whether or
        not the selected input is fitted with a prescaler.

        Example:
                /* PLL3 clock divided by 2 */
                clocks = <&rcc STM32_SRC_PLL3CLK MCO1_SEL(9)>;
                /* PLL3 clock */
                clocks = <&rcc STM32_SRC_PLL3CLK MCO1_SEL(11)>;
