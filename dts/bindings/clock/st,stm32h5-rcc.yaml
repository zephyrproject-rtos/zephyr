        Timers clocks prescalers selection
        Used to control the clock frequency of all the timers connected to APB1 and APB2 domain.
        - When absent: If the APB prescaler (PPRE1, PPRE2 in the RCC_CFGR2 register) is configured
          to a division factor of 1, TIMxCLK = HCKL. Otherwise, the timer clock frequencies are set
          to twice to the frequency of the APB domain to which the timers are connected:
          TIMxCLK = 2xPCLKx.
        - When present: If the APB prescaler (PPRE1, PPRE2 in the RCC_CFGR2 register) is configured
          to a division factor of 1 or 2, TIMxCLK = HCKL. Otherwise, the timer clock frequencies are
          set to four times to the frequency of the APB domain to which the timers are connected:
          TIMxCLK = 4xPCLKx.
