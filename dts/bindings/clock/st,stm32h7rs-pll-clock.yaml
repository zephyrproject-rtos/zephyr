  PLL node binding for STM32H7RS devices

  It can be used to describe 3 different PLLs: PLL1 (Main PLL), PLL2 and PLL3.

  These PLLs could take one of clk_hse, clk_hsi or clk_csi as input clock, with
  an input frequency from 1 to 16 MHz. PLLM factor is used to set the input
  clock in this acceptable range.

  Each PLL can have up to 5 output clocks and for each output clock, the
  frequency can be computed with the following formulae:

    f(PLL_Px) = f(VCOx clock) / PLLPx   -> pllx_p_ck ((pll1_p_ck : sys_ck))
    f(PLL_Qx) = f(VCOx clock) / PLLQx   -> pllx_q_ck
    f(PLL_Rx) = f(VCOx clock) / PLLRx   -> pllx_r_ck
    f(PLL_Sx) = f(VCOx clock) / PLLSx   -> pllx_s_ck
    f(PLL_Tx) = f(VCOx clock) / PLLTx   -> pllx_t_ck (only for PLL2)

      with f(VCOx clock) = f(REFx_CK) Ã— (PLLNx / PLLMx)
