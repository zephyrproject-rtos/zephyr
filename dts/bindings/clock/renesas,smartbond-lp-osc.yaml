    description: |
      Time interval (ms) between oscillator calibrations.
      Setting this value to 0 disables calibration entirely.
      Calibration should only be disabled in tests that require strict thread
      scheduling, where even minimal unexpected CPU usage from calibration
      could cause failures.
