  Microchip Power Management Controller (PMC)

  The Power Management Controller (PMC) optimizes power consumption by
  controlling all system and user peripheral clocks. The PMC enables/disables
  the clock inputs to many of the peripherals and the processor.

  To specify the clocks in a peripheral, the standard clocks property needs
  to be used, e.g.:

    uart: uart@xxx {
      ...
      clocks = <&pmc PMC_TYPE_PERIPHERAL p-id>;
      ...
    };

  In this example the clock-type was defined as PMC_TYPE_PERIPHERAL and the
  peripheral-id was defined as p-id. The p-id number should be consulted on
  datasheet, usually it is available at Product Mapping figure.

  NOTE: The predefined clock type cell is defined at
  include/zephyr/drivers/clock_clontrol/microchip_pic32cxsg_pmc.h header file.

  The clock-type constants are:
    PMC_TYPE_CORE
    PMC_TYPE_SYSTEM
    PMC_TYPE_PERIPHERAL
    PMC_TYPE_GCK
    PMC_TYPE_PROGRAMMABLE

      from common clock binding; shall be set to 2. The first entry is the type
      of the clock (core, system, peripheral or generated) and the second entry
      it's the peripheral identification index as provided by the datasheet.

clock-cells:
  - clock-type
  - peripheral-id
