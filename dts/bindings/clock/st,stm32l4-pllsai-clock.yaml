  PLLSAI node binding for STM32L4 device

  It describes the PLLSAI1 and PLLSAI2 (for supporting devices) PLL.

  These PLL could take one of clk_hse, clk_hsi or clk_msi as input clock, with
  an input frequency from 4 to 16 MHz. PLLSAIM factor is used to set the input
  clock in this acceptable range.

  The PLL can have up to 3 output clocks and for each output clock, the
  frequency can be computed with the following formulae:

    f(PLLSAI_P) = f(VCO clock) / PLLSAIP
    f(PLLSAI_Q) = f(VCO clock) / PLLSAIQ
    f(PLLSAI_R) = f(VCO clock) / PLLSAIR

      with f(VCO clock) = f(PLL clock input) Ã— (PLLSAIN / PLLSAIM)

  The VCO input frequency must be between 2.66 to 8 MHz and its output frequency
  must be between 64 and 344 MHz.

        Division factor for PLLSAI input clock. On series prior to L4+,
        the division factor M is shared between PLL, PLLSAI1 and PLLSAI2
        hence same value should be used for those PLLs when used together.
