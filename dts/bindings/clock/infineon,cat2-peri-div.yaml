      Programmable clock divider types: DIV_16_BIT, DIV_16_5_BIT, DIV_24_5_BIT
  div-value:
    type: int
    description: |
      For non-fractional clock dividers (div-type: DIV_16_BIT)
        Causes integer division of (divider value + 1), 1 to 65536 (16-bit divider).
      For fractional clock dividers (div-type: DIV_16_5_BIT, DIV_24_5_BIT):
        The integer divider value. The source of the divider is peri_clk, which is a
        divided version of hf_clk[0]. The divider value causes integer division of
        (divider value + 1), or division by 1 to 65536 (16-bit divider) or 1 to 16777216
        (24-bit divider).
  div-frac-value:
    type: int
    description: |
      The fraction part of the divider. The fractional divider can be 0-31, thus
      it divides the clock by 1/32 for each count. To divide the clock by 11/32nds
      set this value to 11.
