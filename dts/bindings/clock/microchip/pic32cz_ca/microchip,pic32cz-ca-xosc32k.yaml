      0: The oscillator is always on, if standby-en is true, else run in
         Standby Sleep mode if requested by a peripheral.
      1: Run if requested by peripheral
      Important: Initializing it with 1, along with clock enabled, can lead to indefinite wait for
      the clock to be on, if there is no peripheral request for the clock in the sequence of clock
      Initialization. If required, better to turn on the clock using API, instead of enabling both
      during startup.
