description: |
  The Generic Clock controller (GCLK) features 12 Generic Clock Generators [11:0] that can
  provide a wide range of clock frequencies.

      description: |
        Represent a division value for the corresponding Generator. The actual division factor is
        dependent on the state of div-select (gclk1 0 - 65535, others 0 - 255)

    gclkgen-run-in-standby-en:
      type: int
      enum:
        - 0
        - 1
      default: 0
      description: |
        Keep the Generator running in Standby as long as it is configured to output to a dedicated
        GCLK_IOn pin. If output is not configured to a pin, this field has no effect and the
        generator will only be running if a peripheral requires the clock.

    gclkgen-div-select:
      type: string
      enum:
        - "div-factor"
        - "div-factor-power"
      default: "div-factor"
      description: |
        The Generator clock frequency equals the clock source frequency divided by div-factor
        DIV_FACTOR_POWER: The Generator clock frequency equals the clock source frequency divided
        by 2^(N+1), where N is the div-factor

      type: int
      enum:
        - 0
        - 1

      description: |
        Generator clock output to the corresponding pin, if that pin is not configured as input
        source.

      enum:
        - "low"

      default: "low"
      description: |
        Output value of the corresponding pin, when the Generator is turned off or the output-en is
        false, as long as the pin is not source.
