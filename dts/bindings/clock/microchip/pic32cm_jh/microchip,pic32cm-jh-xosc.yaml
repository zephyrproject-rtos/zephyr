      0: The oscillator is always ON normally.
      In standby sleep mode, oscillator will be OFF if there is no peripheral request,
      unless run-in-standby-en is 1.
      1: In both normal and standby sleep mode, The oscillator is ON,
      when a peripheral is requesting the oscillator to be used as a clock source.
      The oscillator is OFF if no peripheral is requesting the clock source.
      Important: Initializing it with 1, along with clock enabled, can lead to indefinite wait
      for the clock to be on, if there is no peripheral request for the clock in the sequence of
      clock Initialization. If required, better to turn on the clock using API, instead of
      enabling both during startup.

      0: The XOSCn is OFF in standby sleep mode if no peripheral requests the clock.
      1: The XOSCn is always ON in standby sleep mode, unless on-demand-en is 1.
      If on-demand-en is 1, the XOSCn will be ON only when a peripheral is requesting
      the clock, even if run-in-standby-en is 1.
