description: |
  The Generic Clock controller (GCLK) features 12 Generic Clock Generators [11:0] that can
  provide a wide range of clock frequencies.

        Represent a division value for the corresponding Generator. The actual division factor is
        dependent on the state of div-select (gclk1 0 - 65535, others 0 - 255)

        Keep the Generator running in Standby as long as it is configured to output to a dedicated
        GCLK_IOn pin. If output is not configured to a pin, this field has no effect and the
        generator will only be running if a peripheral requires the clock.

        The Generator clock frequency equals the clock source frequency divided by div-factor
        DIV_FACTOR_POWER: The Generator clock frequency equals the clock source frequency divided
        by 2^(N+1), where N is the div-factor
