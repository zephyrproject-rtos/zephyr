title: SAM_D5x_E5x Generic clock peripheral

description: |
  Peripheral channel gclk clock configuration. The outputs from the Generators are used as sources
  for the Peripheral Channels, which provide the Generic Clock (GCLK_PERIPH) to the peripheral
  modules.

      The subsystem cell is to identify a clock controller sub-system.

      The subsystem can be referred from include\zephyr\dt-bindings\clock\mchp_sam_d5x_e5x_clock.h,
      under the GCLKPERIPH_TYPE section of ids.
      All clock control API use this value to specify the clock on which the API operates.
      Since subsystem is opaque to the user, it can be accessed from the devicetree node and used.
