  STM32F0/F3 Main PLL.

  Takes one of clk_hse or clk_hsi as input clock.

  Note: Some STM32F0 SoC variants (STM32072 for instance) may also support HSI48
  as input clock. This case is not supported yet.

  Frequency calculation for output clock is as follows:

    f(PLLCLK) = f(PLLIN) x PLLMUL   --> SYSCLK (System Clock)

    with, depending on the case:
            If input_clk = clk_hse
              f(PLLIN) = f(input_clk) / PREDIV
            If input_clk = clk_hsi
              On STM32F3, STM32F03x, STM32F05x, STM32F030x4, STM32F030x6 and STM32F030x8
                f(PLLIN) = f(input_clk) / 2
              On STM32F04x, STM32F07x, STM32F09x, STM32F070x6, STM32F070xB and STM32F030xC
                f(PLLIN) = f(input_clk) / PREDIV

  The PLL output frequency must be set in range 16-48MHz
