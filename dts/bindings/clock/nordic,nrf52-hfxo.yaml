    description: |
      Startup time in microseconds.

      The value can be obtained by first measuring the time between
      TASKS_HFCLKSTART and EVENTS_HFCLKSTARTED. Then multiply
      the value by 2 to account for temperature and supply variations.

      Note that the startup time will be longer usual on the first
      power-up and as such should not be used to determine
      startup-time-us.
