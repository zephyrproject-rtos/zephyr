      Divider from MCLK (system clock) to ULPCLK (low power clock). ULPCLK must
      be less than or equal to 40 MHz. Valid value is 1 when sourced from SYSOSC
      or LFOSC. Valid values are 1 or 2 when sourced from a high speed clock
      (such as PLL or external clock).

    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      Divider for MCLK (system clock) only when source with SYSOSC with a
      frequency value of 4 MHz. Disabled otherwise. Valid values are 1-16.
