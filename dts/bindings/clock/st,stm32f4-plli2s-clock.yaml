  STM32F4 PLL I2S node binding:

  Takes same input as Main PLL. PLLM factor and PLL source are common with Main PLL

  1 output clocks supported, the frequency can be computed with the following formula:

    f(PLL_R) = f(VCO clock) / PLLR  --> PLLI2S

      with f(VCO clock) = f(PLL clock input) Ã— (PLLNI2S / PLLM)
