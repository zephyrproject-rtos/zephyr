properties:
  hext-bypass:
    type: boolean

      HEXT crystal oscillator bypass
      Set to the property to by-pass the oscillator with an external clock.

  css-enabled:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      HEXT clock security system enabled.

      If a failure is detected on the HEXT clock, the HEXT oscillator is automatically disabled,
      a clock failure event is sent to timers, and a non-maskable interrupt is generated to
      inform the software about the failure, allowing the MCU to perform rescue operations.
      See the MCU reference manual for details.
