  AT32 Clock and Reset (CRM) if a multi-function peripheral in
  charge of reset control (RCTL) and clock control (CCTL) for all SoC
  peripherals. This binding represents the clock controller (CCTL).

  To specify the clocks in a peripheral, the standard clocks property needs
  to be used, e.g.:

    gpioa: gpio@xxx {
        ...
        /* cell encodes CRM register offset and control bit position */
        clocks = <&cctl AT32_CLOCK_GPIOA>;
        ...
    }

  Predefined crm clock cells are available in
  include/zephyr/dts-bindings/clock/at32{xxx}_clocks.h header files, where {xxx}
  corresponds to the SoC series, e.g. f4xx.
