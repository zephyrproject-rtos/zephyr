      - The ID cell is the peripheral identification.

      These information are used on GCLK->CLKCTRL register to select the
      clock for an specific peripheral.

      Example 1: Connect the XOSC32K to RTC on SAMD2x
        Assuming that generator 2 have the following configuration:
          GLKC->GENCTRL:
            SRC: 5 (XOSC32K)
            ID:  2 (Generator 2)

        Then to enable the clock to the peripheral
        Generator:     2
        Identificator: 4 (GCLK_RTC)

          &rtc {
            /* The peripheral is fixed and it is defined at soc devictree
             * clocks property
             */
            clocks = <&gclk 4>, <&pm 0x18 5>;
            clock-names = "GCLK", "PM";

            /* The generator is user selectable and because of that it is
             * defined at board
             */
            atmel,assigned-clocks = <&gclk 2>;
            atmel,assigned-clock-names = "GCLK";
          };

      Example 2: Connect the XOSC32K to RTC on SAMD5x
        In the SAMD5x the RTC is direct connected on the OSC32KCTRL and no
        generator is used. See atmel,sam0-osc32kctrl.yaml for reference.

      - The GEN cell is an integer number that represents the index of
      the generic clock generator. It is usually a number between 0~8
      but could be more depending of the SoC.

clock-cells:
  - id

atmel,assigned-clock-cells:
  - gen
