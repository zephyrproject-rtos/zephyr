title: Silicon Labs Series 2 HFXO (High-Frequency Crystal Oscillator)

description: |
  High-Frequency Crystal Oscillator peripheral on Silicon Labs SoCs.

include: fixed-clock.yaml

properties:
  ctune:
    type: array
    required: true
    description: |
      Load capacitance configuration. If two values are set, they are used for
      XI and XO respectively. If a single value is set, it is used for both.
  precision:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Precision configuration
  internal-bias:
    type: boolean
    description: Enable XI internal DC bias with an external clock. Ignored in xtal mode.
  mode:
    type: string
    description: |
      Mode of operation. Defaults to "xtal", expecting a crystal oscillator on XI and XO
      pins. May be set to "extclk" or "extclkpkdet" to use an external sinusoidal clock
      on the XI pin with or without use of peak detector.
    default: "xtal"
    enum: ["xtal", "extclk", "extclkpkdet"]
