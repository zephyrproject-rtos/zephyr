  STM32G4 main PLL.

  It can take one of clk_hse or clk_hsi as input clock, with
  an input frequency from 2.66 to 16 MHz. PLLM factor is used to set the input
  clock in this acceptable range.

  PLL can have up to 3 output clocks and for each output clock, the
  frequency can be computed with the following formulae:

    f(PLL_P) = f(VCO clock) / PLLP  --> to ADC
    f(PLL_Q) = f(VCO clock) / PLLQ  --> PLL48MCLK (for USB, RNG)
    f(PLL_R) = f(VCO clock) / PLLR  --> PLLCLK (System Clock)

      with f(VCO clock) = f(PLL clock input) Ã— (PLLN / PLLM)

  The PLL output frequency must not exceed 170 MHz.
