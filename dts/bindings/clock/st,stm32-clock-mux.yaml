        STM32 Clock multiplexer

        Describes a clock multiplexer, such as per_ck on STM32H7 or
        CLK48 on STM32WB.
        The only property of this node is to select a clock input.
        For instance:
                &perck {
                        clocks = <&rcc STM32_SRC_HSI_KER CKPER_SEL(0)>;
                        status = "okay";
                };
