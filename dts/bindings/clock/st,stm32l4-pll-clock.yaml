  STM32L4/L5 main PLL.

  It can be used to describe 3 different PLLs: PLL, PLLSAI1 and PLLSAI2.
  Only main PLL is supported for now.

  These PLLs could take one of clk_hse, clk_hsi or clk_msi as input clock, with
  an input frequency from 4 to 16 MHz. PLLM factor is used to set the input
  clock in this acceptable range.

  Each PLL can have up to 3 output clocks and for each output clock, the
  frequency can be computed with the following formulae:

    f(PLL_P) = f(VCO clock) / PLLP  --> PLLSAI3CLK
    f(PLL_Q) = f(VCO clock) / PLLQ  --> PLL48M1CLK
    f(PLL_R) = f(VCO clock) / PLLR  --> PLLCLK (System Clock)

      with f(VCO clock) = f(PLL clock input) Ã— (PLLN / PLLM)

  The PLL output frequency must not exceed 80 MHz.
