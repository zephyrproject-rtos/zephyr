  PLL node binding for STM32L4 and L5 devices

  It can be used to describe 3 different PLLs: PLL, PLLSAI1 and PLLSAI2.

  These PLLs could take one of clk_hse, clk_hsi or clk_msi as input clock, with
  an input frequency from 4 to 16 MHz. PLLM factor is used to set the input
  clock in this acceptable range.

  Each PLL can have up to 3 output clocks and for each output clock, the
  frequency can be computed with the following formulae:

    f(PLLx_P) = f(VCO clock) / PLLxP
    f(PLLx_Q) = f(VCO clock) / PLLxQ
    f(PLLx_R) = f(VCO clock) / PLLxR

      with f(VCO clock) = f(PLL clock input) × (PLLxN / PLLxM)

  The PLL output frequency must not exceed 80 MHz.

        Division factor for the PLL input clock.
        On L4 series, the division factor M is shared between PLL, PLLSAI1
        and PLLSAI2. For these series, valid range is 1 - 8.
        On L4+ and L5 series, each PLL has an independent division factor M.
        For these series, valid range is 1 - 16.
