  STM32WB0 RCC (Reset and Clock controller).

  This node is in charge of the system clock ('SYSCLK') source
  selection and generation.

      Slow clock source selection.
      On STM32WB0, all slow clock devices are clocked from the same
      slow clock source, which is selected by this property.

      The slow clock can be either clk_lsi, clk_lse, or clk_16mhz_div512.

    required: true
    enum:
      - 1

    description: |
      CLK_SYS prescaler. Defines actual core clock frequency (CLK_SYS) based
      on system frequency input (SYSCLK).
      The CLK_SYS is used to clock the CPU, AHB, APB, memories and PKA.

      NOTE: if the 32MHz HSE is used as SYSCLK source, the prescaler cannot
      be set to 64.
