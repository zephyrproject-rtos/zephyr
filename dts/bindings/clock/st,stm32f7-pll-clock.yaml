  STM32F7 Main PLL.

  Takes one of clk_hse or clk_hsi as input clock.

  Up to 2 output clocks could be supported and for each output clock, the
  frequency can be computed with the following formula:

    f(PLL_P) = f(VCO clock) / PLLP  --> PLLCLK (System Clock)
    f(PLL_Q) = f(VCO clock) / PLLQ  --> PLL48CLK (Optional)

      with f(VCO clock) = f(PLL clock input) Ã— (PLLN / PLLM)
