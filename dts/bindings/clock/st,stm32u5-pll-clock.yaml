  PLL node binding for STM32U5 devices

  It can be used to describe 3 different PLLs: PLL1, PLL2 and PLL3.

  These PLLs could take one of clk_hse, clk_hsi or clk_msis as input clock, with
  an input frequency from 4 to 16 MHz. PLLM factor is used to set the input
  clock in this acceptable range.

  Each PLL can have up to 3 output clocks and for each output clock, the
  frequency can be computed with the following formulae:

    f(PLL_P) = f(VCO clock) / PLLP
    f(PLL_Q) = f(VCO clock) / PLLQ
    f(PLL_R) = f(VCO clock) / PLLR

      with f(VCO clock) = f(PLL clock input) Ã— (PLLN / PLLM)

  Note: To reduce the power consumption, it is recommended to configure the VCOx
        clock output to the lowest frequency.

  The PLL output frequency must not exceed 160 MHz.
