  PLLSAI node binding for STM32F4 and STM32F7 device

  Takes one of clk_hse or clk_hsi as input clock.

  The PLL can have up to 3 output clocks and for each output clock, the
  frequency can be computed with the following formulae:

    f(PLLSAI_P) = f(VCO clock) / PLLSAIP
    f(PLLSAI_Q) = f(VCO clock) / PLLSAIQ
    f(PLLSAI_R) = f(VCO clock) / PLLSAIR

      with f(VCO clock) = f(PLL clock input) Ã— (PLLSAIN / PLLSAIM)

  The PLL clock input is shared with other PLLs (PLL / PLLI2S) of the
  SoC hence all PLLs must have the same source set.

        Division factor for PLLSAI input clock.
        On STM32F446xx, the division M factor is independent from
        other PLLs.
        On all other SoCs, the division factor M is shared between
        PLL, PLLSAI and PLLI2S, hence same value should be used
        for those PLLs when used together.
