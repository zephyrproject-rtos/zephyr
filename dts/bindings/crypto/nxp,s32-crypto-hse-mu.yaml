  NXP S32 HSE Messaging Unit. The Messaging Unit (MU) module facilitates communication between
  HSE processor core and application processor core (e.g any of RTU core) on a chip.
  Processors side-A inside the MU is accessible only by HSE core, whether side-B is accessible
  by application core. To enable a dedicated MU instance for Crypto operation:
    &mub0 {
      status = "okay";
    };
