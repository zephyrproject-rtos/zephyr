include: base.yaml

properties:
  reg:
    required: true

  interrupts:
    required: true

  dmas:
    description: |
      Optional CHA & CHB DMA specifiers. Each specifier will have a phandle
      reference to the DMA controller, the channel number, and the peripheral
      trigger source.

      Example for channels 4/5 with aestrga/aestrgb trigger sources:
        dmas = <&dma 4 3>, <&dma 5 4>;

      For ECB mode:
        - CHA moves plaintext data into buffer registers when AES operation starts,
        - CHB moves ciphertext to memory when AES completes.
      For CTR (also used by CCM):
        - CHA moves plaintext data into text XOR registers when AES operation starts,
        - CHB moves ciphertext to memory after CHA has written the last text XOR register.
      For CBC-MAC (also used by CCM):
        - CHA moves plaintext data into buffer when AES operation starts,
        - CHB is not used.

  dma-names:
    description: |
      Required if the dmas property exists. These must be "cha" and "chb"
      to match the dmas property.

      Example:
        dma-names = "cha", "chb";
