  Atmel SAM SUPC (Supply-Controller) controller

  The supply controller manages the voltage reference, power supply and supply
  monitoring of the device. It have a special feature that it can wake-up the
  device from a low-power state using special peripherals as wake-up sources.

  The dedicated peripherals that can wake-up the core supply domain are: RTC,
  RTT, Supply Monitor and GPIOs. In the first three peripherals it is necessary
  inform the wakeup-source-id property on their respective nodes.

    rtc: rtc@xxx {
      ...
      wakeup-source-id = <&supc SUPC_WAKEUP_SOURCE_RTC>;
      ...
    };

  The special peripheral will wake-up the device only when the standard property
  wakeup-source is defined, e.g.:

    &rtc {
      ...
      wakeup-source;
      ...
    };

  The SUPC wakeup source ids that can be enabled are defined in the
  zephyr/include/zephyr/dt-bindings/power/atmel_sam_supc.h header file.
