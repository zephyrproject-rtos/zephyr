      Selects the System Active power profile:
        - POWER_PROFILE_0 (LP MCU + Radio ON): All peripheral and CPU power modes are
        available with a maximum configurable CPU clock at 96 MHz with a regulated
        voltage of 1.1 V. Bluetooth® functionality is available because the radio
        module is powered ON.

        - POWER_PROFILE_1 (ULP MCU + Radio ON): All CPU peripherals and power modes are
        available with the maximum frequency of 48 MHz and operating at 1.0 V voltage
        regulation (see Regulator operations). Bluetooth® functionality is available because
        the radio module is powered ON.

        - POWER_PROFILE_2A (LP MCU Only): All peripheral and CPU power modes are available at
        full speed (96 MHz) with a regulated voltage of 1.1 V, but Bluetooth® functionality is not
        available because the radio module is in OFF state. The core buck voltage and mode are set
        to high power 1.16 V and SDR0 is set to regulated 1.1 V.

        - POWER_PROFILE_2B (LP MCU Only): All peripheral and CPU power modes are available at
        full speed (96 MHz) with a regulated voltage of 1.1 V, but the Bluetooth® functionality is
        not available because the radio module is in OFF state. The core buck voltage and mode are
        set to low-power 1.1 V and SDR0 is set to bypassed 1.1 V.

        - POWER_PROFILE_3 (ULP MCU Only): All CPU peripherals and power modes are available
        with the maximum frequency of 48 MHz and operating with a regulated voltage of 1.0 V.
        Bluetooth® radio module is turned OFF.
