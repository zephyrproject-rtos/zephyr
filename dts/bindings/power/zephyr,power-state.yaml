  Properties for power management idle states.

compatible: "zephyr,power-state"

properties:
  power-state-name:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: indicates a power state
    enum:
      - "active"
      - "runtime-idle"
      - "suspend-to-idle"
      - "standby"
      - "suspend-to-ram"
      - "suspend-to-disk"
      - "soft-off"
  substate-id:
    type: int
    description: Platform specific identification.
  min-residency-us:
    type: int
    description: |
      Minimum residency duration in microseconds.

      How much time the residency in a given idle state must last for state entry
      to be worthwhile energywise. It includes the time to enter into this state
      and represents the "break-even" time to justify the time and power spent
      on the work needed for entering and exiting the state based on how much actual energy
      is saved once in the state, compared to choosing the next shallowest state.
  exit-latency-us:
    type: int
    description: |
        Worst case latency in microseconds required to exit the idle state.
  zephyr,pm-device-disabled:
    type: boolean
    description: |
       Disable system managed device power management for this state. When set,
       the power management subsystem will not suspend devices before entering
       this state.
