properties:
  power-state-name:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: indicates a power state
    enum:
      - "active"
      - "runtime-idle"
      - "suspend-to-idle"
      - "standby"
      - "suspend-to-ram"
      - "suspend-to-disk"
      - "soft-off"
  substate-id:
    type: int
    description: Platform specific identification.
  min-residency-us:
    type: int
    description: |
        Minimum residency duration in microseconds. It is the minimum time for a
        given idle state to be worthwhile energywise. It includes the time to enter
        in this state.
  exit-latency-us:
    type: int
    description: |
        Worst case latency in microseconds required to exit the idle state.
  zephyr,pm-device-disabled:
    type: boolean
    description: |
       Disable system managed device power management for this state. When set,
       the power management subsystem will not suspend devices before entering
       this state.
  zephyr,pm-turn-on-off-action:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      By default, system managed device power management invokes the
      PM_DEVICE_ACTION_SUSPEND and PM_DEVICE_ACTION_RESUME actions.
      Enabling this will make system managed device power management invoke
      the PM_DEVICE_ACTION_TURN_OFF and PM_DEVICE_ACTION_TURN_ON actions in
      this state.
