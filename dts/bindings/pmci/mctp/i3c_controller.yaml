compatible: "zephyr,mctp-i3c-controller"

properties:
  i3c:
    type: phandle
    description: |
      I3C controller that is used as an MCTP bus.

  endpoints:
    type: int
    description: |
      Number of MCTP endpoints supported by the I3C controller

  endpoint-ids:
    type: array
    description: |
      MCTP endpoint ids, length must match the number of endpoints

  endpoint-pids:
    type: array
    description: |
      I3C provisional ids of endpoints, an array of 2 32bit values. The length of
      which must match the described number of endpoints. The value must contain
      a valid i3c provisional id. An associated dts node with this provisional id
      must exist so that the I3C device handle may be obtained using it.
