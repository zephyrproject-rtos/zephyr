  Base binding for generic radio hardware capabilities that are not specific
  to any wireless protocol or vendor.

  These properties describe hardware-supported features that are common across
  different vendors but are not part of any specific wireless protocol
  specification. They are read-only and indicate what the hardware is capable
  of, not what features are currently enabled.

properties:
  radio-tx-high-power-supported:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If set, indicates that the radio hardware supports high TX power settings.
      This capability enables transmission beyond standard power levels
      (typically >10 dBm).

      This property should be treated as read-only and should not be overridden;
      the correct value is provided for your target's SoC already.
