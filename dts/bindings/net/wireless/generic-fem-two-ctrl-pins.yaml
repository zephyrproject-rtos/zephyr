    Generic radio Front-End Module (FEM) with a two-pin
    control interface (CTX, CRX).

    The CTX control pin is used to enable the Power Amplifier (PA) in
    the transmit path. This is therefore sometimes referred to as
    the "PA pin" in other contexts.

    The CRX control pin is used to enable the Low Noise Amplifier
    (LNA) in the receive path, and is sometimes referred to as
    the "LNA pin" in other contexts.

    Each of these pins is optional, and may be omitted if not present.
    (Though if you do specify a pin, you must also specify its
    corresponding settle-time-us property.)
