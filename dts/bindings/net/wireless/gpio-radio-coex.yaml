    Generic representation of Coexistence pin interface for radios. This
    interface is usually available on Wifi/Bluetooth/LTE modules to
    interact with each other when sharing the same antenna. This prevents
    any collisions between transmissions from different modules. The grant
    signal should signal that the external transceiver/module is not
    transmitting. Therefore you are free to perform any TX operations as
    required. When grant pin becomes inactive then you have time to
    finish all of the ongoing TX operations before the external
    transceiver begins their transmission. This is specified by the
    grant-delay-us property.
