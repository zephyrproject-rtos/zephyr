# Common fields for MDIO controllers

include: base.yaml

bus: mdio

properties:
  "#address-cells":
    required: true
    const: 1

  "#size-cells":
    required: true
    const: 0

  suppress-preamble:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      When present, the SMA suppresses the 32-bit preamble and transmits
      MDIO frames with only 1 preamble bit. By default, the MDIO frame
      always has 32 bits of preamble as defined in the IEEE 802.3 specs.

  clock-frequency:
    type: int
    default: 2500000
    description: |
      Some MDIO controllers have the ability to configure the MDC frequency.
      If present, this property may be used to specify the MDC frequency based
      on what the PHYs connected to the mdio bus can support. Default of 2.5MHz
      is the standard and should supported by all PHYs.
