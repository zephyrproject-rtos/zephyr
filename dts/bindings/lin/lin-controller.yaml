# Common fields for LIN controllers

include: base.yaml

properties:
  bitrate:
    type: int
    description: |
      Initial bitrate in bit/s. If this is unset, the initial bitrate is set to
      CONFIG_LIN_DEFAULT_BITRATE.

  master-role:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Set to true if the LIN controller is a master. If this is unset, the LIN
      controller is a slave.

  conflict-detection:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Set to true to enable LIN bus conflict detection. If this is unset,
      conflict detection is disabled.

  auto-sync:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Set to true to enable automatic synchronization of the LIN controller.

  break-len:
    type: int
    default: 13
    description: |
      Length of the break field in bits.

  break-delimiter:
    type: int
    enum: [1, 2]
    default: 1
    description: |
      Length of the break delimiter in bits.

  phys:
    type: phandle
    description: |
      Actively controlled LIN transceiver.

child-binding:
  description: |
    Passive LIN transceiver. The child node must be named "lin-transceiver".

    Example:
      &lin0 {
        status = "okay";

        lin-transceiver {
          max-bitrate = <200000>;
        };
      };

  properties:
    min-bitrate:
      type: int
      description: |
        Minimum bitrate in bit/s supported by the transceiver.

    max-bitrate:
      type: int
      description: |
        Maximum bitrate in bit/s supported by the transceiver.
