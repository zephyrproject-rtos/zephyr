description: STM32 MIPI DSI host

compatible: "st,stm32-mipi-dsi"

include: [mipi-dsi-host.yaml, reset-device.yaml]

properties:
  clocks:
    required: true

  clock-names:
    required: true
    description: |
      "dsiclk" DSI clock enable.
      "refclk" External crystal or oscillator clock.
      "pixelclk" LTDC pixel clock.
      "refclk" and "pixelclk" are only used to retrieve the frequency for timing calculation.

  resets:
    required: true

  hs-active-high:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      DSI host horizontal synchronization is active high.

  vs-active-high:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      DSI host vertical synchronization is active high.

  de-active-high:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      DSI host data enable is active high.

  non-continuous:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      DSI host enable non continuous clock.

  pll-ndiv:
    required: true
    type: int
    description: |
      DSI host dedicated PLL loop division factor.

  pll-idf:
    required: true
    type: int
    description: |
      DSI host dedicated PLL input division factor.

  pll-odf:
    required: true
    type: int
    description: |
      DSI HOST dedicated PLL output division factor.

  active-errors:
    type: int
    description: |
      Indicates which error interrupts will be enabled.
      This parameter can be any combination of DSI_Error_Data_Type and
      defaults to HAL_DSI_ERROR_NONE.

  lp-rx-filter:
    type: int
    description: |
      Use Low-Power Reception Filter. Cutoff frequency of low-pass filter at the input of LPRX.
      Defaults to 0 which disables the filter.
