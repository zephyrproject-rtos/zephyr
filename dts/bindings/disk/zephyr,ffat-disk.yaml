  Fake FAT (FFAT) disk
  FFAT disk emulates a disk formatted with the FAT16 or FAT32 file system to
  export specific data or information to a host system, for example, using USB
  MSC support. This binding is a format to describe the virtual disk geometry
  as if it were a real hardware disk, so the resulting fake file system
  capacity is slightly smaller.
