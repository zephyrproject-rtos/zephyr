  Andes DMA controller
  channel: a phandle to the DMA controller plus the following four integer cells:
    1. channel: the dma channel
    2. slot: DMA peripheral request ID
    3. channel-config: A 32bit mask specifying the DMA channel configuration
    which is device dependent:
        -bit 0-1 : Direction  (see dma.h)
                0x0: MEM to MEM
                0x1: MEM to PERIPH
                0x2: PERIPH to MEM
                0x3: reserved for PERIPH to PERIPH
        -bit 2 : Peripheral Increment Address
                0x0: no address increment between transfers
                0x1: increment address between transfers
        -bit 3 : Memory Increment Address
                0x0: no address increment between transfers
                0x1: increment address between transfers
        -bit 4-6 : Peripheral data size
                0x0: Byte (8 bits)
                0x1: Half-word (16 bits)
                0x2: Word (32 bits)
                0x3: Double word (64 bits)
                0x4: Quad word (128 bits)
                0x5: Eight word (256 bits)
                0x6-0x7: reserved
        -bit 7-9 : Memory data size
                0x0: Byte (8 bits)
                0x1: Half-word (16 bits)
                0x2: Word (32 bits)
                0x3: Double word (64 bits)
                0x4: Quad word (128 bits)
                0x5: Eight word (256 bits)
                0x6-0x7: reserved
        -bit 10 : Priority level
                0x0: lower priority
                0x1: higher priority
