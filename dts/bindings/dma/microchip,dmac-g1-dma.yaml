  Microchip G1 DMA driver.

  Group G1 DMA driver supports following hardware peripherals:
    - module name="DMAC" id="U2503" version="1.0.1"

compatible: "microchip,dmac-g1-dma"

include: dma-controller.yaml

properties:
  reg:
    type: array
    required: true
    description: |
      Specifies the base address and size of the DMA controller's
      memory-mapped registers.

  interrupts:
    type: array
    required: true
    description: |
      Defines the list of interrupt numbers associated with the DMA controller.

  clocks:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      A reference to the clock source used by the DMA controller.

  clock-names:
    type: string-array
    required: true
    description: |
      The name of the clock source referenced in the 'clocks' property.

  dma-channels:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      The number of DMA channels available in the DMA controller.

  dma-alignment:
    type: int
    default: 16
    description: |
      Specifies the required memory alignment for DMA transfers.
      The value should be set to 16 for 128-bit alignment.

  "#dma-cells":
    type: int
    const: 2
    description: |
      Specifies the number of cells used for the DMA specifier.

# #dma-cells : Must be <2>.
# The 1st cell specifies the DMAC channel to be used for the data transfer.
#   This channel should be unique between all peripherals that are using the
#   DMAC instance.
# The 2nd cell defines the peripheral trigger which is the source of the transfer.
#   For details on trigger selection and trigger modes, refer to
#   "Transfer Triggers and Actions".
#   See the SoC's reference manual for all the supported request sources.
#
# Example of devicetree dma channel configuration:
#
# &sercom3 {
#     /* Configure DMA channels for async operation */
#     dmas = <&dmac 10 7>, <&dmac 11 8>;
#     dma-names = "rx", "tx";
# };
#
# In above fragment 10 and 11 represents the different channels used to
# transfer data between peripheral and ram. The numbers 7/8 are, for instance,
# uart_rx/tx peripheral trigger for sercom3.
dma-cells:
  - channel
  - trigsrc
