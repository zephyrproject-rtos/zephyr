# The 1st cell specifies the hardware handshaking signal ID
# Example of device-tree dma channel configuration:

# &spi0 {
#      /* Configure DMA */
#   dmas = <&dma0 18>, <&dma0 19>;
#   dma-names = "tx", "rx";
# };
#
# In above spi node numbers 18 and 19 represents the
# peripheral handshaking interface ID
