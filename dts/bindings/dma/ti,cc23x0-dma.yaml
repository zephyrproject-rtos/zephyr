      The 1st cell specifies the DMA channel to be used for the data transfer.
      This channel should be unique between all peripherals that are using the
      DMA instance.
      The 2nd cell defines the peripheral trigger which is the source of the transfer.
      See the SoC's reference manual for all the supported request sources.

      Example of devicetree DMA channel configuration for the client part:

      &uart0 {
          dmas = <&dma 0 7>, <&dma 1 6>;
          dma-names = "rx", "tx";
      };

      Above, fragment 0 and 1 represent the different channels used to transfer
      data between peripheral and RAM. The numbers 7/6 are uart0 rx/tx triggers.

dma-cells:
  - channel
  - trigsrc
