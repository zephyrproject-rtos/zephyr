include: dma-controller.yaml

properties:
  reg:
    required: true
    description: |
      Specifies base physical address(s) and size of DMA and respective DMAMUX register(s)
      that routes DMA sources

  interrupts:
    required: true

  dma-channels:
    required: true

  dma-requests:
    required: true

  dmamux-reg-offset:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description:
      The offset value for obtaining DMAMUX register index from DMAMUX channel.
      Default value means DMAMUX channel is identical with DMAMUX register index

  channel-gap:
    type: array
    description: |
      On some platforms, there may be a gap in the channels and
      this array specifies the start and end of a single gap

  nxp,mem2mem:
    type: boolean
    description: If the DMA controller supports memory to memory transfer

  nxp,a_on:
    type: boolean
    description: If the DMA controller supports always on

  irq-shared-offset:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Describes an offset between two channels share the same interrupt entry.
      Default value means each channel has separate interrupt entry.

  no-error-irq:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If the SoCs don't have a separate interrupt id for error IRQ.

  nxp,version:
    type: int
    enum:
      - 2
      - 3
      - 4
    description: |
      eDMA IP revision number.

  channels-shared-irq-mask:
    type: array
    description: |
      Describes channel enabled mask value on every IRQ.
      The channel number is mapped to the bit value of array element value.
      If the interrupt is shared on one channel number, the correspongding
      bit is set to 1.
      Please note each element of the array must be 32-bit. If there are more
      than 32 channels, add one or more 32-bit elements in array(elements
      should be contiguous). The software will determine the mask value of
      several elements corresponding to the same interrupt according to the
      number of channels.

  "#dma-cells":
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Number of items to expect in a DMAMUX specifier

# - #dma-cells : Must be <2>.
#  The 1st cell specifies the DMA channel which will be used
#  The 2nd cell specifies the request source (slot) ID.
#    See the SoC's reference manual for all the supported request sources.

dma-cells:
  - mux
  - source
