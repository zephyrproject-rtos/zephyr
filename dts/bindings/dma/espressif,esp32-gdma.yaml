  ESP32 GDMA (General Direct Memory Access)

  General Direct Memory Access (GDMA) is a feature that allows
  peripheral-to-memory, memory-to-peripheral, and memory-to-memory
  data transfer at a high speed.

  The GDMA controller in ESP32-C3 has six independent channels,
  three transmit channels and three receive channels.

  Every channel can be connected to different peripherals.

  ESP32C3's Peripherals with GDMA:
  * SPI2
  * UHCI0 (UART0/UART1)
  * I2S
  * AES (Not Supported yet)
  * SHA (Not Supported yet)
  * ADC

  The GDMA controller in ESP32-S3 has ten independent channels,
  five transmit channels and five receive channels. Only six are
  supported, meaning three transmit and three receive channels.

  ESP32S3's Peripherals with GDMA:
  * SPI2
  * SPI3
  * UHCI0
  * I2S0
  * I2S1
  * LCD/CAM
  * AES (Not Supported yet)
  * SHA (Not Supported yet)
  * ADC
  * RMT (Not Supported yet)
