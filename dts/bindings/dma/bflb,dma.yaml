  Bouffalo Lab DMA

  BFLB platforms support 4 (BL60x and BL61x) to 8 (BL70x) independent DMA channels.
  Every channel is capable of memory-to-memory, memory-to-peripheral, peripheral-to-memory and
  peripheral-to-peripheral access.
  All channels support 8, 16, and 32 bit width memory access.
  Each channel can be triggered by independent peripheral hardware or software.
