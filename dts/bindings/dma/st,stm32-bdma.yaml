  STM32 BDMA controller

  The STM32 BDMA is a general-purpose direct memory access controller
  capable of supporting 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 independent BDMA channels.
  Each channel can have up to 8 requests.
  BDMA clients connected to the STM32 BDMA controller must use the format
  described in the dma.txt file, using a four-cell specifier for each
  channel: a phandle to the BDMA controller plus the following four integer cells:
    1. channel: the bdma stream from 0 to <bdma-requests>
    2. slot: bdma request
    3. channel-config: A 32bit mask specifying the BDMA channel configuration
    which is device dependent:
        -bit 6-7 : Direction  (see dma.h)
               0x0: MEM to MEM
               0x1: MEM to PERIPH
               0x2: PERIPH to MEM
               0x3: reserved for PERIPH to PERIPH
        -bit 9 : Peripheral Increment Address
               0x0: no address increment between transfers
               0x1: increment address between transfers
        -bit 10 : Memory Increment Address
               0x0: no address increment between transfers
               0x1: increment address between transfers
        -bit 11-12 : Peripheral data size
               0x0: Byte (8 bits)
               0x1: Half-word (16 bits)
               0x2: Word (32 bits)
               0x3: reserved
        -bit 13-14 : Memory data size
               0x0: Byte (8 bits)
               0x1: Half-word (16 bits)
               0x2: Word (32 bits)
               0x3: reserved
        -bit 15: Peripheral Increment Offset Size
               0x0: offset size is linked to the peripheral bus width
               0x1: offset size is fixed to 4 (32-bit alignment)
        -bit 16-17 : Priority level
               0x0: low
               0x1: medium
               0x2: high
               0x3: very high

      offset in the table of channels when mapping to a DMAMUX
      for 1st dma instance, offset is 0,
      for 2nd dma instance, offset is the nb of dma channels of the 1st dma,
      for 3rd dma instance, offset is the nb of dma channels of the 2nd dma
      plus the nb of dma channels of the 1st dma instance, etc.
