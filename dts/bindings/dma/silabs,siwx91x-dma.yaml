        SRAM Address for UDMA Descriptor Storage. This address must correspond to the location
        of the udma_addr0 section in the linker script for the dma0 node, and the udma_addr1
        section for the ulpdma node. Ensure that the value specified for the SRAM address matches
        the respective section defined in the linker file for each UDMA node, as this alignment
        is critical for proper descriptor management and data transfer.
