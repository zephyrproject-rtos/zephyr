  STM32 DMAMUX controller

  The STM32 DMAMUX is a direct memory access multiplexer
  capable of supporting independent DMA channels.
  DMAMUX clients connected to the STM32 DMA ultiplexer must use a two-cell specifier
  for each dmamux channel: a phandle to the DMA multiplexer plus the following 2 integer cells:
    1. channel: the mux channel from 0 to <dma-channels> - 1
    2. slot: the request line Multiplexer ID
    3. channel-config: A 32bit mask specifying the DMA channel configuration
    which is device dependent:
        -bit 6-7 : Direction  (see dma.h)
               0x0: MEM to MEM
               0x1: MEM to PERIPH
               0x2: PERIPH to MEM
               0x3: reserved for PERIPH to PERIPH
        -bit 9 : Peripheral Increment Address
               0x0: no address increment between transfers
               0x1: increment address between transfers
        -bit 10 : Memory Increment Address
               0x0: no address increment between transfers
               0x1: increment address between transfers
        -bit 11-12 : Peripheral data size
               0x0: Byte (8 bits)
               0x1: Half-word (16 bits)
               0x2: Word (32 bits)
               0x3: reserved
        -bit 13-14 : Memory data size
               0x0: Byte (8 bits)
               0x1: Half-word (16 bits)
               0x2: Word (32 bits)
               0x3: reserved
        -bit 15: Peripheral Increment Offset Size not USED for DMA V2
               0x0: offset size is linked to the peripheral bus width
               0x1: offset size is fixed to 4 (32-bit alignment)
        -bit 16-17 : Priority level
               0x0: low
               0x1: medium
               0x2: high
               0x3: very high

         compatible = "st,stm32-dmamux";
         ...

         dma-generators = <4>;
         dma-requests= <36>;
         status = "disabled";
        };
    for client SPI of stm32wb55x
