      Use this property to specify which channel indexes are
      to be considered valid. The difference between this
      property and "dma-channels" is the fact that this
      property allows you to have "gaps" between the channel
      indexes. This is useful in cases where you know you're
      not going to be using all of the possible channels, thus
      leading to a more readable DTS. Of course, this property
      and "dma-channels" are mutually exclusive, meaning you
      can't specify both properties as this will lead to a
      BUILD_ASSERT() failure.
  "#dma-cells":
    const: 2

# IMPORTANT: if your EDMA version doesn't support channel MUX-ing please
# leave the MUX cell as 0. This is not mandatory for the driver as the
# MUX value will be ignored in this case but all entities using EDMA should
# be consistent in this regard.
dma-cells:
  - channel
  - mux
