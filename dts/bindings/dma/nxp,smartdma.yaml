      Program memory to load SMARTDMA routines into. Must be set to a RAM
      region that the SMARTDMA can access on the chip.

  # SmartDMA does not support channels, so no DMA cells should be provided.
  # the driver or application using SMARTDMA can set the DMA program to run
  # using the `dma_slot` parameter.
