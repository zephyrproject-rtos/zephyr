  This charger is represented by device tree child node, e.g:

  charger: bq24190@6b {
      compatible = "ti,bq24190";
      reg = <0x6b>;
      status = "okay";

      constant-charge-current-max-microamp = <1000000>;
      constant-charge-voltage-max-microvolt = <3800000>;
  };

include: [battery.yaml, i2c-device.yaml]

compatible: "ti,bq24190"

properties:
  constant-charge-current-max-microamp:
    required: true
    description: |
      The charge current target for the constant current phase of the charge profile.
      This value will be set at initialization time. Range: 512 mA to 4.544 A.
      The value specified will be rounded down to the closest implemented value.

  constant-charge-voltage-max-microvolt:
    required: true
    description: |
      The voltage regulation target for the constant voltage phase of the battery charging profile.
      This value will be set at initialization time. Range: 3.504 V to 4.400 V.
      The value specified will be rounded down to the closest implemented value.
