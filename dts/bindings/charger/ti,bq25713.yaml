  charger: bq25713@6b {
      compatible = "ti,bq25713";
      reg = <0x6b>;
      status = "okay";

      constant-charge-current-max-microamp = <1000000>;
      constant-charge-voltage-max-microvolt = <3800000>;
      system-voltage-min-threshold-microvolt = <3328000>;
  };

properties:
  constant-charge-current-max-microamp:
    required: true
    description: |
      The charge current target for the constant current phase of the charge profile.
      This value will be set at initialization time. Range: 0 mA to 8.128 A.
      The value specified will be rounded down to the closest implemented value.

  constant-charge-voltage-max-microvolt:
    required: true
    description: |
      The voltage regulation target for the constant voltage phase of the battery charging profile.
      This value will be set at initialization time. Range: 4.2 V 1S to 16.8 V 4S.
      The value specified will be rounded down to the closest implemented value.

  system-voltage-min-threshold-microvolt:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Minimum system voltage.
      Voltage that will be set above when the system voltage drops this level.
      This value will be set at initialization time. Range: 1.024 V to 16.128 V.
      The value specified will be rounded down to the closest implemented value.
