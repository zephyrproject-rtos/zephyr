properties:
  constant-charge-current-max-microamp:
    type: int
    required: true
    default: 100000
    description: |
      Fast Charge current set at init time in uA, available range is 2.5mA to 640mA.
      The value specified will be rounded down to the closest implemented
      value. If set to 0 (default) skip setting the charge current value at
      driver initialization.

  constant-charge-voltage-max-microvolt:
    type: int
    required: true
    default: 4200000
    description: |
      The maximum voltage that the battery will be charged at, defaults to
      4.2V, matching the device default reset configuration.

  precharge-current-percent:
    type: int
    enum:
      - 7
      - 16
    default: 16
    description: |
      Precharge current as x%(7% or 16%) of Fast charge current.
      Refer to CHARGER_CNTL_1 register description for details.

  charge-termination-current-percent:
    type: int
    enum:
      - 25
      - 50
      - 75
      - 100
    default: 25
    description: |
      Topoff current as x%*10 (2.5%, 5.0%, 7.5%, or 10.0%)
      of Fast charge current. Charge will finish when charging
      current is less than topoff current.
      Refer to CHARGER_CNTL_4 register description for details.

  re-charge-threshold-microvolt:
    type: int
    enum:
      - 100000
      - 150000
      - 200000
    default: 100000
    description: |
      Recharge threshold in relation to Vbat_reg.
      Refer to CHARGER_CNTL_4 register description for details.

  input-current-limit-microamp:
    type: int
    default: 470000
    description: |
      Input current limit on VIN, available range is 45mA to 1195mA.

  system-voltage-min-threshold-microvolt:
    type: int
    default: 4550000
    description: |
      System regulation voltage. It is higher 200mV than Vbat_reg.
      Vbatreg will clamp by Vsys_reg - 200mV.
