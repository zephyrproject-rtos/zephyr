  Arm Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP) Power Controller (PWRC)

  The FVP PWRC provides CPU power management capabilities on Arm Fixed Virtual
  Platform models. This hardware block is part of the Base_PowerController
  component and controls CPU power states for bare-metal operation when PSCI
  firmware is not available.

  The PWRC registers include:
  - PPOFFR (0x00): Power off processor request
  - PPONR (0x04): Power on processor request
  - PCOFFR (0x08): Power off cluster request
  - PWKUPR (0x0c): Wakeup request control
  - PSYSR (0x10): System power status register

  For system reset operations, this controller requires access to the V2M
  System Registers (vexpress-sysreg).
