  NXP Operational Amplifier (opamp)

include:
  - name: opamp-controller.yaml
  - name: reset-device.yaml

compatible: "nxp,opamp"

properties:
  non-inverting-reference:
    type: string
    enum:
      - "Input0"
      - "Input1"
      - "Input2"
      - "Input3"
    description: |
      Selects non-inverting path reference voltage source.
      The actual meaning of each option:
      "Input0": MCU internal DAC out
      "Input1": VDD / 2
      "Input2": MCU internal VREF out
      "Input3": Fixed 520mv

  operation-mode:
    type: string
    enum:
      - "low_noise"
      - "high_speed"
    default: "low_noise"
    description: |
      Selects opamp operation mode.
      Reasons why set default value to low_noise:
      1. Matches the value after register reset.
      2. If there is no special high slew rate requirement,
      there is no need to change the mode to high speed mode.
      The actual meaning of each option:
      "low_noise": OPAMP in low noise mode
      "high_speed": OPAMP in high slew rate mode

  enable-measure-reference:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Specifies whether the measure positive gain resistor ladder
      reference voltage switch is on or off for ADC channel.

  enable-measure-output:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Specifies whether the measure negative gain resistor ladder
      voltage switch is on or off for ADC channel.
