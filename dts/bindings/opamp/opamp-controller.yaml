      Selects opamp functional mode.

      a) inverting Mode

      - Input signal applied to inverting (-) terminal
      - Non-inverting (+) terminal connected to ground
      - Feedback resistor connects output to inverting input
      - Output is 180Â° out of phase with input
      - Gain = -Rf/Rin, where Rf is the feedback resistor and Rin is the input resistor

      b) non_inverting Mode

      - Input signal applied to non-inverting (+) terminal
      - Inverting (-) terminal connected to feedback network
      - Output is in phase with input
      - Gain = 1 + (Rf/Rin), where Rf is the feedback resistor and Rin is the input resistor
      Higher input impedance than inverting mode

      c) follower Mode (voltage follower or buffer)

      - Special case of non-inverting amplifier
      - Unity gain (gain = 1)
      - Direct feedback from output to inverting input
      - Very high input impedance, very low output impedance
      - Used for impedance matching

      d) differential Mode

      - Signals applied to both inputs
      - Amplifies the difference between two input signals
      - Common-mode signals are rejected
      - Used in instrumentation and noise rejection

      e) standalone Mode

      - The opamp mode is defined by external circuitry

      If the OPAMP supports programmable gain, then the gain of
      the opamp can be changed dynamically at runtime. The gain
      value needs to be one of the enumerations above.
      Gain selection:
      - OPAMP_GAIN_1_7  : x 1/7
      - OPAMP_GAIN_1_3  : x 1/3
      - OPAMP_GAIN_1    : x 1
      - OPAMP_GAIN_5_3  : x 5/3
      - OPAMP_GAIN_2    : x 2
      - OPAMP_GAIN_11_5 : x 11/5
      - OPAMP_GAIN_3    : x 3
      - OPAMP_GAIN_4    : x 4
      - OPAMP_GAIN_13_3 : x 13/3
      - OPAMP_GAIN_7    : x 7
      - OPAMP_GAIN_8    : x 8
      - OPAMP_GAIN_15   : x 15
      - OPAMP_GAIN_16   : x 16
      - OPAMP_GAIN_31   : x 31
      - OPAMP_GAIN_32   : x 32
      - OPAMP_GAIN_33   : x 33
      - OPAMP_GAIN_63   : x 63
      - OPAMP_GAIN_64   : x 64
