  NXP Fast slew rate Operational Amplifier (opamp_fast)

include:
  - name: opamp-controller.yaml

compatible: "nxp,opamp-fast"

properties:
  bias-current:
    type: int
    enum:
      - 0
      - 1
      - 2
      - 3
    default: 0
    description: |
      Bias current config selection, change power consumption.
      Reasons why set default value to 0:
      1. Matches the value after register reset.
      2. If there is no special power consumption requirement,
      there is no need to change the bias current.
      The actual meaning of each option:
      0: Default value. Keep power consumption constant
      1: Reduce power consumption to 1/4
      2: Reduce power consumption to 1/2
      3: Double the power consumption

  compensation-capcitor:
    type: int
    enum:
      - 0
      - 1
      - 2
      - 3
    default: 0
    description: |
      Compensation capcitor config selection,
      choose different bits to fit different gains.
      The actual meaning of each option:
      0: Fit 2X gains
      1: Fit 4X gains
      2: Fit 8X gains
      3: Fit 16X gains
      Reasons why set default value to 0:
      1. Matches the value after register reset.

  is-reference-source:
    type: boolean
