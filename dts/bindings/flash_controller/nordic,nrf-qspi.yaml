    Properties defining the interface for the Nordic QSPI peripheral.

    The reg property describes two register blocks: one for the memory
    corresponding to the QSPI peripheral registers, and another for
    the memory mapped XIP area:

        qspi: qspi@2b000 {
                compatible = "nordic,nrf-qspi";
                reg = <0x2b000 0x1000>, <0x10000000 0x10000000>;
                reg-names = "qspi", "qspi_mm";
                ...
        };

    Above, the register block with base address 0x2b000 and name
    "qspi" are the QSPI peripheral registers. The register block with
    base address 0x10000000 and name "qspi_mm" is the XIP area.
