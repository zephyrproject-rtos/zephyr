      This property provides a byte which should used to enable non-permanent
      readout protection (RDP1). Actually, any byte except 0xAA and 0xCC
      (which are used by RDP0 and RDP2 respectively) can be used to enable
      RDP1 but in multi-image environment, some other image could check if
      RDP1 is enabled by comparing it to some hardcoded value. The byte has to
      be different than 0xAA and 0xCC.
