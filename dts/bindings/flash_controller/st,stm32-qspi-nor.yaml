    STM32 QSPI Flash controller supporting the JEDEC CFI interface

                 Now only value of 4 (when using SIO[0123]) is supported.
  writeoc:
    type: string
    enum:
      - "PP_1_1_4"      # Quad data line SPI, PP 1-1-4 (0x32)
      - "PP_1_4_4"      # Quad data line SPI, PP 1-4-4 (0x38)

      The value encodes number of I/O lines used for the opcode,
      address, and data.

      There is no info about quad page program opcodes in the SFDP
      tables, hence it has been assumed that NOR flash memory
      supporting 1-4-4 mode also would support fast page programming.

      If absent, then 1-4-4 program page is used in quad mode.
