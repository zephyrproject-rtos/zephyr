    STM32 QSPI Flash controller supporting the JEDEC CFI interface

                 Now only value of 4 (when using SIO[0123]) is supported.
  writeoc:
    type: string
    enum:
      - "PP_1_1_4"      # Quad data line SPI, PP 1-1-4 (0x32)
      - "PP_1_4_4"      # Quad data line SPI, PP 1-4-4 (0x38)

      The value encodes number of I/O lines used for the opcode,
      address, and data.

      There is no info about quad page program opcodes in the SFDP
      tables, hence it has been assumed that NOR flash memory
      supporting 1-4-4 mode also would support fast page programming.

      If absent, then 1-4-4 program page is used in quad mode.

  requires-ulbpr:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Indicates the device requires the ULBPR (0x98) command.

      Some flash chips such as the Microchip SST26VF series have a block
      protection register that initializes to write-protected.  Use this
      property to indicate that the BPR must be unlocked before write
      operations can proceed.

    type: int
    default: 8
    description: The number of dummy-cycles required when reading jedec id

  cs-high-time:
    type: int
    default: 8
    enum:
      - 1
      - 2

      Minimum number of QSPI clock cycles the chip select signal must remain
      high between commands issued to the flash memory.

      The minimum acceptable value depends on the flash memory model and the
      QSPI clock frequency. Using a value higher than the minimum required
      by the flash memory would not lead to communication errors but is
      suboptimal as it would reduce the throughput.

      Defaults to 8 clock cycles, which is the maximum supported value.
