    STM32 QSPI Flash controller supporting the JEDEC CFI interface

        The value encodes number of I/O lines used for the opcode,
        address, and data.

        There is no info about quad page program opcodes in the SFDP
        tables, hence it has been assumed that NOR flash memory
        supporting 1-4-4 mode also would support fast page programming.

        If absent, then 1-4-4 program page is used in quad mode.
