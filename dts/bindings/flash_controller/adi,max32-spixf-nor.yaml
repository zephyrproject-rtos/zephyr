    MAX32 SPIXF NOR Flash controller supporting the JEDEC CFI interface

    Representation of a serial flash on a SPIXF bus:

            writeoc = "PP_1_1_4";

on-bus: qspi

properties:
  reg:
    required: true
    description: Flash Memory base address and size in bytes
  qspi-max-frequency:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Maximum clock frequency of device's QSPI interface in Hz
  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: RESETn pin
  reset-gpios-duration:
    type: int
    description: The duration (in ms) for the flash memory reset pulse
  reset-cmd:
    type: boolean
    description: Send reset command on initialization
  reset-cmd-wait:
    type: int
    default: 35
    description: |
      The duration (in us) to wait after reset command. The default value of
      35us is long enough for commonly used NOR flash, but this can be
      adjusted as needed based on the specific flash used.
  spi-bus-width:
    type: int
    description: The width of (Q)SPI bus to which flash memory is connected.
                 Now only value of 4 (when using SIO[0123]) is supported.
  writeoc:
    type: string
    enum:
      - "PP_1_1_4"      # Quad data line SPI, PP 1-1-4 (0x32)
      - "PP_1_4_4"      # Quad data line SPI, PP 1-4-4 (0x38)

      The value encodes number of I/O lines used for the opcode,
      address, and data.

      There is no info about quad page program opcodes in the SFDP
      tables, hence it has been assumed that NOR flash memory
      supporting 1-4-4 mode also would support fast page programming.

      If absent, then 1-4-4 program page is used in quad mode.

  force-quad-address-write:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Force 4 I/O lines for addressing even when using PP_1_1_4 writes.
      This is mostly useful for Microchip NOR flash which require this quirk.
