    The SPI NOR flash devices accessed by Nuvoton Flash Interface Unit (FIU).

    Representation of a SPI NOR flash on a qspi bus looks like:

      int_flash: w25q40@0 {
            compatible ="nuvoton,npcx-fiu-nor";
            size = <DT_SIZE_K(512 * 8)>;
            reg = <0>;

            qspi-flags = <NPCX_QSPI_SW_CS1>;
            mapped-addr = <0x64000000>;
            pinctrl-0 = <&int_flash_sl>;
            pinctrl-names = "default";
      };

compatible: "nuvoton,npcx-fiu-nor"

properties:
  mapped-addr:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Mapped memory address of direct read access for spi nor flash.
  max-timeout:
    type: int
    default: 10000
    description: Typically, it equals to max timeout of chip erase in ms.

    description: The definitions for configuring the Quad-SPI peripherals.
  rd-mode:
    type: string
    default: "NPCX_RD_MODE_FAST_DUAL"
    description: |
      Selects the SPI read access type of Direct Read Access. Usually, we choose
      Fast Read Dual I/O mode for better performance. If the nor spi flash does
      not support this mode, please set this property explicitly.
    enum:
      - "NPCX_RD_MODE_NORMAL" # Direct read access by command code 03h
      - "NPCX_RD_MODE_FAST" # Direct read access by command code 0bh
      - "NPCX_RD_MODE_FAST_DUAL" # Direct read access by command code bbh
  spi-dev-size:
    type: string
    description: |
      Select the size of the address space allocated for SPI device. This affects
      the address space for any direct flash access.
