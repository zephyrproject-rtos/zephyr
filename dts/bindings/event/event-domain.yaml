  Event domain

  Event domains map combinations of event device states to
  the resulting maximum latency of events within said domain.

  Example:

    / {
            event-domains {
                    wakeup_event_domain: wakeup {
                            compatible = "event-domain";

                            /*
                             * List of resulting maximum event latencies within domain
                             * mapped to event-device-states by index.
                             */
                            event-latencies-us = <260 /* Mapped to event-device-states idx 0 */
                                                  30  /* Mapped to event-device-states idx 1 */
                                                  9   /* Mapped to event-device-states idx 2 */
                                                  6>; /* Mapped to event-device-states idx 3 */

                            /* List of devices for which event states will be applied */
                            event-devices = <&cpu &power &rram>;
