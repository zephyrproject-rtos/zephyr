bus: sd

properties:
  max-current-330:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Max drive current in mA at 3.3V. A value of zero indicates no maximum
      is specified by the driver.

  max-current-300:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Max drive current in mA at 3.0V. A value of zero indicates no maximum
      is specified by the driver.

  max-current-180:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Max drive current in mA at 1.8V. A value of zero indicates no maximum
      is specified by the driver.

  max-bus-freq:
    type: int
    default: 400000
    description: |
      Maximum bus frequency for SD card. This should be the highest frequency
      the SDHC is capable of negotiating with cards on the bus.

  min-bus-freq:
    type: int
    default: 400000
    description: |
      Minimum bus frequency for SD card. This should be the frequency that
      cards first will select when attached to the SDHC bus

  power-delay-ms:
    type: int
    default: 500
    description: |
      time in ms for SDHC to delay when toggling power to the SD card. This
      delay gives the card time to power up or down fully
