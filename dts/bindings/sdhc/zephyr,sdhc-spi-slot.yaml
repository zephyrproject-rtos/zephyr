include: [spi-device.yaml]

properties:
  power-delay-ms:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      Time in ms for SPI SDHC to delay when toggling power to the SD card. This
      delay gives the card time to power up or down fully. It can be increased
      if you observe issues initializing your card.

  spi-clock-mode-cpol:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Clock polarity to use for SPI SDHC. Some cards respond properly
      only when the clock goes low when not active.

  spi-clock-mode-cpha:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Clock phase: this dictates when is the data captured, and depends
      on the clock's polarity. When mode-cpol is set and this option as well,
      capture will occur on low to high transition and high to low if
      this option is not set (default).

  pwr-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Power pin
      This pin defaults to active high when consumed by the SPI SDHC driver.
      It can be used to toggle card power via an external control circuit

bus: sd
