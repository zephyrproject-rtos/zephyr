properties:
  reg:
    required: true

  data-timeout:
    type: int
    default: 0xF
    description: |
      Data timeout, as multiple of the SD clock. See DTOCV field of USDHC

  read-watermark:
    type: int
    default: 0x80
    description: |
      Number of words used as read watermark level in FIFO queue for USDHC

  write-watermark:
    type: int
    default: 0x80
    description: |
      Number of words used as write watermark level in FIFO queue for USDHC

  max_current_330:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Max drive current in mA at 3.3V. A value of zero indicates no maximum
      is specified by the driver.
  clocks:
    required: true

  pwr-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Power pin
      This pin defaults to active high when consumed by the SD card. The
      property value should ensure the flags properly describe the signal
      that is presented to the driver.

  cd-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Detect pin
      This pin defaults to active low when produced by the SD card. The
      property value should ensure the flags properly describe the signal
      that is presented to the driver.

  no-1-8-v:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      When the external SD card circuit does not support 1.8V, add this
      property to disable 1.8v card voltage of SD card controller.

  detect-dat3:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable the host to detect an SD card via the DAT3 line of the SD card
      connection. Requires the board to define a function to pull DAT3 low or
      high using pullup/pulldown resistors.
