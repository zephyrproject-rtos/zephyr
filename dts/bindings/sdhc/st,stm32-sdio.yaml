description: Common properties for STM32 SDIO Host Controller peripheral.

compatible: "st,stm32-sdio"

bus: sd

include: [sdhc.yaml, pinctrl-device.yaml, reset-device.yaml]

properties:
  hw-flow-control:
    type: boolean
    description: Set to enable RTS/CTS flow control at boot time.

  sdhi-on-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: GPIO used to enable/disable the SDHI.

  cd-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: Card detect pin.

  clocks:
    required: true

  reg:
    required: true

  pinctrl-0:
    required: true

  pinctrl-names:
    required: true

  support-1-8-v:
    type: boolean
    description: |
        When defined, it indicates that the external SDIO circuit supports 1.8V signaling.

  bus-width:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
        Bus width for SDMMC access, defaults to the minimum necessary
        number of bus lines.
    enum:
      - 1
      - 4
      - 8

  clk-div:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
        Clock division factor for SDMMC. Typically the clock operates at 25MHz so
        a division factor of 2 would be 25MHz / 2 = 12.5MHz.
        The valid range is 0 to 1023.
