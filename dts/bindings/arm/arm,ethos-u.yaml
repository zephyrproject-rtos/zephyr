    The Arm Ethos-U is a micro NPU that enables neural networks to be hardware
    accelerated on embedded devices. The Ethos-U NPU driver is provided as a
    Zephyr module that is hooked up into the Tensorflow Lite Micro framework
    as a 'TFLM custom operation'.

    This device tree entry defines board specific properties like the register
    map address and interrupt line, and is therefore expected to be included
    into the device specific device tree file.
