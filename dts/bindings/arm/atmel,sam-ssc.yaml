      TX & RX dma specifiers.  Each specifier will have a phandle
      reference to the dma controller, the channel number, and peripheral
      trigger source.

      For example dmas for TX, RX would look like
         dmas = <&xdmac 22 DMA_PERID_SSC_TX>, <&xdmac 23 DMA_PERID_SSC_RX>;

  dma-names:
    required: true
    description: |
      This should be "tx" and "rx" to match the dmas property.

      For example
         dma-names = "tx", "rx";
