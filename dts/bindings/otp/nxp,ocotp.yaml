  NXP On-Chip OTP (One-Time Programmable) controller.

  This binding represents the OCOTP peripheral found on NXP i.MX RT series
  and similar SoCs. The OCOTP module provides access to on-chip fuse memory
  used to store configuration data, security keys, MAC addresses, and other
  device-specific information.

  The driver integrates with the NVMEM subsystem, allowing individual fuse
  values to be accessed through nvmem-layout child nodes that define specific
  memory regions.

  Note: The OTP driver API uses byte addressing, while the OCOTP peripheral
  has 32-bit wide registers. When specifying the 'reg' property in nvmem-layout
  child nodes, use byte offsets. The driver handles the conversion between byte
  addresses and register indices internally.
