  NXP Real Time Clock (RTC) â€” JDP-generation RTC IP.

  This RTC device features a SoC-specific clock-source
  mux and a programmable prescaler. It is not interchangeable with
  "nxp,rtc" compatible device.

compatible: "nxp,rtc-jdp"

include:
  - rtc.yaml
  - rtc-device.yaml

properties:
  reg:
    required: true

  clock-source:
    type: int
    required: true
    enum:
      - 0
      - 1
      - 2
      - 3

      Select the RTC clock source (chip-specific mux). No binding-wide default
      is provided because the hardware reset default differs by SoC. The SoC
      dtsi must set this to the correct value for each instance.

  prescaler:
    type: int
    default: 1
    enum:
      - 1
      - 32
      - 512
      - 16384

      Divider for the RTC clock source. Supported divide values are 1, 32, 512, or 16384.
