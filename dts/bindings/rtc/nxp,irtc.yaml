      The input clock select for IRTC.
      0 <- 16.384 kHz

      Enable clock as an output for other peripherals to use.
      0 <- No clock output
      1 <- Fine 1Hz
      2 <- Buffered Oscillator Clock
      3 <- Coarse 1Hz
      Default value ensures the output clock is turned off.
      This is the reset value.

  share-counter:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      This secondary IRTC instance shares the data and time counters of the primary IRTC instance.
      This means the code cannot set the data and time counters, but can only read them.
