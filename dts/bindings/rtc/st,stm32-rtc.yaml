  alarms-count:
    description: |
      Number of alarms supported by STM32 RTC device.
      Most of STM32 MCU series have 2 RTC alarms, A & B.

    type: int
    description: |
      Number of the Extended Interrupts and Event Controller (EXTI) interrupt
      line connected to the RTC Alarm event.
      Not required, since RTC Alarm interrupt could be routed directly to Nested
      Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC) and to Power Control (PWR) wake-up
      pins on some series.
      Valid range: 0 - 31
