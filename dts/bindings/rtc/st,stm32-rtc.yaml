properties:
  reg:
    required: true

  sync-prescaler:
    type: int
    description: |
      RTC synchronous prescaler value. Optional, if not set defaulted in code to:
      - Selected to give 1 Hz tick rate, based on source clock frequency and asynchronous
        prescaler value.

  async-prescaler:
    type: int
    description: |
      RTC asynchronous prescaler value. Optional, if not set defaulted in code to:
      - 0x7F if RTC source clock is LSE/LSI
      - 1 if using counter with CONFIG_COUNTER_RTC_STM32_SUBSECONDS option
      - 0x7C if RTC source clock is HSE

  hse-prescaler:
    type: int
    description: |
      RTC HSE prescaler value. Applies only when RTC source clock is HSE.
      Optional, defaulting to the value calculated based on HSE clock frequency
      to give the highest possibly prescaled source frequency below 1MHz.

  calib-out-freq:
    type: int
    description: |
      Calibration output frequency (1 Hz or 512 Hz).
    enum:
      - 1
      - 512

  alarms-count:
    description: |
      Number of alarms supported by STM32 RTC device.
      Most of STM32 MCU series have 2 RTC alarms, A & B.
      Defaults to 0 when not declared in devicetree.

  alrm-exti-line:
    type: int
    description: |
      Number of the Extended Interrupts and Event Controller (EXTI) interrupt
      line connected to the RTC Alarm event.
      Not required, since RTC Alarm interrupt could be routed directly to Nested
      Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC) and to Power Control (PWR) wake-up
      pins on some series.
      Valid range: 0 - 31
