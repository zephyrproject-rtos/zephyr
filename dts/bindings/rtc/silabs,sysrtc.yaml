title: Silicon Labs Series 2 SYSRTC (System Real Time Clock)

description: |
  The SYSRTC (System Real Time Counter) is a 32-bit counter kept running down to energy mode EM3.
  It can be used as a sleep timer / wakeup source as well as a timekeeping counter during low energy
  modes. Multiple groups of capture / compare registers are available to different cores in the
  system, allowing the peripheral and time base to be shared across cores and save energy.
