title: Microchip G1 RTC driver

description: |
  Microchip RTC driver.

  This driver configures the RTC peripheral in Microchip
  microcontrollers for clock and interrupts.

  Group g1 RTC driver supports following hardware peripherals:
    - module name="RTC" id="U2250" version="2.1.0"

  The node has the 'rtc' node label set in your SoC's devicetree, so you can
  modify it like this:

    &rtc {
        /* your modifications go here */
    };

    Example:
    Correction in ppm = (FREQCORR.VALUE * 1e6 ppm) / (8192 * 128)

    &rtc {
      cal-constant = <1048576>; /* 8192 * 128 */
    };

compatible: "microchip,rtc-g1"

include:
  - name: rtc.yaml
  - name: pinctrl-device.yaml

properties:
  reg:
    required: true
    description: |
      Register base address and size for the RTC peripheral.

  clocks:
    required: true
    description: |
      Clock phandles used to drive the RTC.

  clock-names:
    required: true
    description: |
      Clock name corresponding to the `clocks` entry.

  interrupts:
    required: true
    description: |
      Interrupt specifier for the RTC peripheral.

  prescaler:
    type: int
    enum:
      - 1
      - 2
      - 4
      - 8
      - 16
      - 32
      - 64
      - 128
      - 256
      - 512
      - 1024
    description: |
      RTC frequency equals clock-frequency divided by the prescaler value

  alarms-count:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Number of alarms supported by RTC device.

      The number of alarms defaults to 0, which indicates that the RTC has
      no alarms.

  cal-constant:
    type: int
    description: |
      Define the constant used to calculate the calibration.

      More information can be found in the datasheet of each SoC series at
      RTC Frequency Correction topic.
