title: Silicon Labs Series 2 Sleeptimer

description: |
        The Silabs Gecko stimer is primarily used as a low-power
        real-time counter that allows for precise timekeeping.
        The sleeptimer utilizes hardware timer(SYSRTC) to manage ticks
        and timeouts. gecko stimer uses sleeptimer service from Silicon
        Labs SDK which can run mulitple sw timers using a single counter.
        The sleeptimer service itself manages the IRQ handling, and the
        gecko stimer driver seamlessly connects to the IRQ utilized by
        the sleeptimer service.
