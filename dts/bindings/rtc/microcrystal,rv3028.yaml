properties:
  clkout-frequency:
    type: int
    enum:
      - 32768
      - 8192
      - 1024
      - 64

    description: |
      Frequency of the CLKOUT signal in Hertz (Hz). If omitted, the CLKOUT pin is LOW.

  backup-switch-mode:
    type: string
    required: true
    enum:
      - disabled
      - direct
      - level
    description: |
      Automatic backup switchover function selection:
        - disabled: The switchover function is disabled - only one power supply available (VDD)
        - direct: Direct Switching Mode (DSM): when VDD < VBACKUP, switchover occurs from VDD to
          VBACKUP without requiring VDD to drop below VTH:LSM (2.0 V)
        - level: Level Switching Mode (LSM): when VDD < VTH:LSM (2.0 V) AND VBACKUP > VTH:LSM,
          switchover occurs from VDD to VBACKUP

  trickle-resistor-ohms:
    type: int
    enum:
      - 3000
      - 5000
      - 9000
      - 15000
    description: |
      Enable the trickle charger with provided current-limiting resistance in ohms. The trickle
      charger allows a battery or supercapacitor connected to VBACKUP to be charged.

  int-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      GPIO connected to the RV3028 INT interrupt output. This signal is open-drain, active low.
