    Test pin controller pin configuration nodes. Each node is composed by one or
    more groups, each defining the configuration for a set of pins.

      Test pin controller pin configuration group. Each group contains a list of
      pins sharing the same set of properties. Example:

      /* node representing default state for test_device0 */
      test_device0_default: test_device0_default {
        /* group 1 (name is arbitrary) */
        pins1 {
          /* configure pins 0 and 1 */
          pins = <0>, <1>;
          /* both pins 0 and 1 have pull-up enabled */
          bias-pull-up;
        };
        ...
        /* group N (name is arbitrary) */
        pinsN {
          /* configure pin M */
          pins = <M>;
          /* pin M has pull-down enabled */
          bias-pull-down;
        };
      };

      The list of supported standard properties:

      - bias-pull-up: Enable pull-up resistor.
      - bias-pull-down: Enable pull-down resistor.

        description: |
          An array of pins sharing the same group properties. Each entry is a
          32-bit integer that is just used to identify the entry for testing
          purposes.
