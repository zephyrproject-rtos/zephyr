  Simple monitorig power domain

  This power domain monitors the state of a GPIO pin to detect whether a power
  rail is on/off. Therefore, performing resume/suspend on power domain won't
  change physical state of power rails and that action won't be triggered on
  child nodes. Additionally, due to the asynchronous nature of monitoring, a
  pending transaction won't be interrupted by power state change.
