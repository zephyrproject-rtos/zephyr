properties:
  enable-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      GPIO to use to enable/disable the regulator.

      Unlike the gpio property in the Linux bindings this array must
      provide the GPIO polarity and open-drain status in the phandle
      selector.  The Linux enable-active-high and gpio-open-drain
      properties are not valid for Zephyr devicetree files.

  startup-delay-us:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 0
    description: Startup time, in microseconds

  off-on-delay-us:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 0
    description: Off delay time, in microseconds
