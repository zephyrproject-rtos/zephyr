title: Tachometer sensor using GPIO.

description: |
  This tachometer sensor uses GPIO interrupts to measure the duration of one
  pulse to calculate the RPM.

      Milliseconds to wait for a complete pulse.
      Default is 1 s. This allows reading down to about 120 RPM (not 60
      because the measurement might start right after a pulse start).
