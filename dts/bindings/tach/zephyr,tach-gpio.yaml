title: Tachometer sensor using GPIO.

description: |
  This tachometer sensor uses GPIO interrupts to measure the duration of one
  pulse to calculate the RPM.

compatible: "zephyr,tach-gpio"

include: tach.yaml

  timeout-ms:
    type: int
    default: 1000
    description: |
      Milliseconds to wait for a complete pulse.
      Default is 1 s. This allows reading down to about 120 RPM (not 60
      because the measurement might start right after a pulse start).

  pulses-per-round:
    type: int
    description: Number of pulses per round.
    required: true
