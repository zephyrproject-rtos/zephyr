description: IT51XXX I3CM controller

compatible: "ite,it51xxx-i3cm"

include: [i3c-controller.yaml, pinctrl-device.yaml]

properties:
  reg:
    required: true

  interrupts:
    required: true

  io-channel:
    required: true
    type: int
    enum: [0, 1, 2, 3]
    description: |
      The it51xxx chip features four i3c io channels and two i3c cotroller
      (i3cm) engines. This property allows the i3cm engine to select the
      desired i3c io channel. To ensure proper i3c functionality, make sure
      that multiple controllers (including the i3cm controller and i3cs
      target engines) are not assigned the same io channel.

  i3c-pp-duty-cycle:
    default: 50
    type: int
    description: |
      The duty cycle of push-pull frequency(unit in percentage).

  i3c-od-scl-hz:
    required: true
    type: int
    description: |
      The open-drain frequency for the i3c controller.

  i3c-scl-hddat:
    type: int
    description: |
      i3c data hold time(0 by default). The time is calculated as:
      t_hddat = (i3c-scl-hddat + 1) * 20.8ns. The range of i3c-scl-hddat is
      [63:0].

  i3c-scl-tcas:
    type: int
    description: |
      i3c clock after start condition(1 by default). The time is calculated as:
      t_cas = (i3c-scl-tcas + 1) * 20.8ns. The maximum value is 255.

  i3c-scl-tcbs:
    type: int
    description: |
      i3c clock before stop condition(0 by default). The time is calculated as:
      t_cbs = (i3c-scl-tcbs + 1) * 20.8ns. The maximum value is 255.

  i3c-scl-tcasr:
    type: int
    description: |
      i3c clock after repeated start condition(1 by default). The time is
      calculated as: t_casr = (i3c-scl-tcasr + 1) * 20.8ns. The maximum value
      is 255.

  i3c-scl-tcbsr:
    type: int
    description: |
      i3c clock before repeated start condition(0 by default). The time is
      calculated as: t_cbsr = (i3c-scl-tcbsr + 1) * 20.8ns. The maximum value
      is 255.

  i2c-scl-hddat:
    type: int
    description: |
      i2c data hold time(0 by default). The time is calculated as:
      t_hddat = (i2c-scl-hddat + 1) * 20.8ns. The range of i3c-scl-hddat is
      [65535:0].
