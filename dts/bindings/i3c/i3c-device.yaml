      Contains 3 fields.

      For I3C devices, the 3 fields are static address, first half
      of Provisioned ID, and the second half of the Provisioned ID.
        1. The static address can be assigned to be the target device's
           dynamic address before Dynamic Address Assignment (DAA)
           starts. Can be zero if static address is not used, and
           target address is determined via DAA.
        2. First half of the Provisioned ID contains the manufacturer
           ID left-shifted by 1, where the manufacturer ID is
           the bits 33-47 (zero-based) of the 48-bit Provisioned ID.
        3. Second half of the Provisioned ID contains the combination of
           the part ID (bits 16-31 of the Provisioned ID) left-shifted
           by 16, and the instance ID (bits 12-15 of the Provisioned ID)
           left-shifted by 12. Basically, this is the lower 32 bits
           of the Provisioned ID.

      Note that the DT node of a I3C target device should be in format
      "<node name>@<address + PID>", e.g. "sensor@4200001234012345678",
      where the PID part is expanded to be a 64-bit integer.

      For I2C devices, the 3 fields are static address, 0x00, and
      value of the Legacy Virtual Register (LVR).
         1. 7-bit address of the I2C device. (Note that 10-bit
            addressing is not supported.)
         2. Always 0x00.
         3. LVR describes the I2C device where,
            * bit[31:8]: unused.
            * bit[7:5]: I2C device index:
                * Index 0: I2C device has a 50 ns spike filter where
                           it is not affected by high frequency on SCL.
                * Index 1: I2C device does not have a 50 ns spike filter
                           but can work with high frequency on SCL.
                * Index 2: I2C device does not have a 50 ns spike filter
                           and cannot work with high frequency on SCL.
                * Other values are reserved.
            * bit[4]: I2C mode indicator:
                * 0: FM+ mode
                * 1: FM mode
            * bit[3:0]: reserved.

      The DT node of a I2C device should be in format
      "<node name>@<address + 00000000 + LVR>",
      e.g. "sensor@5000000000000000FF", where the middle 0x00 and LVR
      are both expanded to 32-bit integers.

  assigned-address:
    type: int
    description: |
      Dynamic address to be assigned to the device.

  supports-setaasa:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Indicates if the device supports the CCC SETAASA. If true, it will
      be used as an optimization for bus initialization.
