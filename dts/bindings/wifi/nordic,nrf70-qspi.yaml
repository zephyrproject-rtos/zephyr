include: ["nordic,nrf70.yaml", "base.yaml"]

on-bus: qspi

properties:
  qspi-frequency:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Maximum clock speed (in Hz) supported by the device.

  reg:
    required: true

  qspi-quad-mode:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If specified, Use QSPI in quad mode (4 IO lines) otherwise in
      SPI mode (2 IO lines - MOSI & MISO).

  qspi-rx-delay:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Number of clock cycles from the rising edge of the SPI clock
      until the input serial data is sampled.

  qspi-cpha:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Set to indicate phase starts with asserted half-phase (CPHA=1).
      The driver using this property must also use `cpol`.

  qspi-cpol:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Set to indicate that the clock leading edge is falling (CPOL=1).
      The driver using this property requires also use `cpha`.
