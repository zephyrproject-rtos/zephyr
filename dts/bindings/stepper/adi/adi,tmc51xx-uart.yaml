  Analog Devices TMC51XX Stepper Motor Controller (UART single-wire mode)

  This binding supports the single-wire UART mode where:
  - SWIOP is connected to the MCU's UART TX/RX pin
  - SWION should be connected to half the IO level voltage (1.65V for 3.3V systems)
  - SW_SEL must be HIGH (either via GPIO control or hardwired)

  Example:

    &uart2 {
        current-speed = <115200>;
        status = "okay";

        tmc51xx: tmc51xx {
            compatible = "adi,tmc51xx";
            sw-sel-gpios = <&gpiob 0x01 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;

            /* Common settings from base binding */
            clock-frequency = <DT_FREQ_M(12)>;
            en-pwm-mode;
            invert-direction;

            tmc51xx_stepper_driver: stepper_driver {
                compatible = "adi,tmc51xx-stepper-driver";
                micro-step-res = <256>;

                /* ADI TMC stallguard settings specific to TMC51XX */
                stallguard2-threshold=<9>;
            };

            /* common stepper controller settings */
            tmc51xx_motion_controller: motion_controller {
              compatible = "adi,tmc51xx-motion-controller";

              /* ADI TMC stallguard settings specific to TMC5160 */
              activate-stallguard2;
              stallguard-velocity-check-interval-ms = <100>;
              stallguard-threshold-velocity = <50000>;

              /* ADI TMC ramp generator as well as current settings */
              vstart = <10>;
              a1 = <20>;
              v1 = <30>;
              d1 = <40>;
              vmax = <50>;
              amax = <60>;
              dmax = <70>;
              tzerowait = <80>;
              thigh = <90>;
              tcoolthrs = <100>;
              tpwmthrs = <110>;
              tpowerdown = <120>;
              ihold = <1>;
              irun = <2>;
              iholddelay = <3>;
            };
        };
    };
