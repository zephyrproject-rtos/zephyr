description: Global configuration flags for Trinamic stepper controller.

properties:
  en-spreadcycle:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      A high level on the pin SPREAD inverts this flag to switch between both chopper modes.
      0: StealthChop mode
      1: SpreadCycle mode enabled

  i-scale-analog:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      0: Use internal reference derived from 5VOUT
      1: Use voltage supplied to VREF as current reference

  internal-rsense:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      0: Operation with external sense resistors
      1: Internal sense resistors. Use current supplied into VREF as reference for internal
         sense resistor. VREF pin internally is driven to GND in this mode.

  index-otpw:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      0: INDEX shows the first microstep position of sequencer
      1: INDEX output shows step pulses from internal pulse generator (toggle upon each step)

  index-step:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      0: INDEX output as selected by index-otpw
      1: INDEX pin shows the current step position of sequencer

  pdn-disable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      0: Normal operation
      1: Power down mode

  mstep-reg-select:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      0: Microstep resolution selected by pins MS1, MS2
      1: Microstep resolution selected by MRES register

  poscmp-enable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable position compare feature
      0: Outputs INT and PP are tristated.
      1: Position compare pulse (PP) and interrupt output (INT) are available

      Attention – do not leave the outputs floating in tristate condition, provide an external
      pull-up or set poscmp-enable=1

  test-mode:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable test mode
      0: Normal operation
      1: Enable analog test output on pin REFR2
      TEST_SEL selects the function of REFR2: 0…4: T120, DAC1, VDDH1, DAC2, VDDH2

      Attention: Not for user, set to 0 for normal operation!

  lock-gconf:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      1: GCONF is locked against further write access.
