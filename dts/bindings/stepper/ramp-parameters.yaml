  Collection of ramp parameters for stepper motors.

properties:
  acceleration:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Maximum acceleration in micro-steps per second squared.

  max-speed:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Maximum speed in micro-steps per second.

  deceleration:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Maximum deceleration in micro-steps per second squared.

  pre-decel-steps:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Maximum Number of steps over which to decelerate while changing motor-direction
      during active ramping, Higher number corresponds to longer deceleration, hence
      smoother change in direction of motion

  ramp-type:
    type: int
    description: |
      Type of ramping to be used. The options are:
      1: Linear ramping - trapezoidal ramping with constant acceleration and deceleration
      Further ramping types can be added in <include/zephyr/dt-bindings/stepper/ramp.h>
    default: 1
    enum:
      - 1
