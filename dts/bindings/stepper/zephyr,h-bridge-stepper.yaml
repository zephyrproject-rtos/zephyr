  GPIO Stepper Controller for darlington transistor arrays or dual H-bridge

  Example:
    /* Lead A is connected Lead C and Lead B is connected to Lead D*/
    h_bridge_stepper: h_bridge_stepper {
        compatible = "zephyr,h-bridge-stepper";
        gpios = <&gpioa 9 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,  /* Lead A1/A */
                <&gpioc 7 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,  /* Lead B1/B */
                <&gpiob 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,  /* Lead A2/C */
                <&gpioa 7 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;  /* Lead B2/D */
    };

compatible: "zephyr,h-bridge-stepper"

properties:
  invert-direction:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Invert motor direction.

  gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      The gpio pin array on which the stepper inputs are to be connected

  lut-step-gap:
    type: int
    default: 1
    enum:
      - 1
      - 2
    description: |
      Step mode selection.
      1 - Half step mode
      2 - Full step mode

  counter:
    type: phandle
    description: |
      Counter used for generating step-accurate pulse signals.
      This should be a reference to a counter node in the device tree.
      When this property is present, the stepper motion controller will use
      the counter as a timing source instead of the default work queue timing.
      This enables more precise step timing control.
