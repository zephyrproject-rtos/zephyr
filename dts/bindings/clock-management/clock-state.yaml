  Statically defined clock configurations for this clock output. Each
  configuration should define a frequency and settings for parent nodes of
  this clock to produce that frequency.

      Settings for parent nodes of this clock output to realize the
      defined frequency. If these settings are absent, the clock framework
      will attempt to use runtime rate setting if "CONFIG_CLOCK_MANAGEMENT_SET_RATE"
      is enabled

    description: Frequency this configuration produces, in Hz
  locking-state:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If present, a consumer that applies this state will also lock the clock to
      the frequency given by this state. This allows consumers to enforce a
      requirement that their clock properties do not change.
