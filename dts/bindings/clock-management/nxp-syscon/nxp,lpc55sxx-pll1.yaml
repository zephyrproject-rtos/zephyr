  LPC SYSCON LPC55Sxx PLL1. The node configures PLL1 on the LPC55Sxx series.
  The node accepts six specifiers, which have the following meanings:
  - frequency: output frequency (before postdiv) this PLL will generate.
    Set to 0 to power down.
  - ndec: PLL pre divider setting
  - mdec: PLL multiplier setting
  - selr: Bandwidth select R value. Should be 0 for normal applications
  - seli: Bandwidth select I value. See reference manual to calculate this
  - selp: Bandwidth select P value. See reference manual to calculate this
  PLL1 operates as a fractional PLL, with the following
  output equation: (input_clock * (mdec / ndec))

compatible: "nxp,lpc55sxx-pll1"
