  LPC SYSCON LPC55Sxx PLL0. The node configures PLL0 on the LPC55Sxx series,
  which offers a spread spectrum generator. The node accepts nine specifiers,
  which have the following meanings:
  - frequency: output frequency (before postdiv) this PLL will generate.
    Set to 0 to power down.
  - ndec: PLL pre divider setting
  - mdec: If nonzero, sets PLL0 to use provided MDEC value in normal mode
  - selr: Bandwidth select R value. Should be 0 for normal applications
  - seli: Bandwidth select I value. See reference manual to calculate this
  - selp: Bandwidth select P value. See reference manual to calculate this
  - sscg_en: If nonzero, use PLL0 in spread spectrum mode.
  - sscg0: sets SSCG0 register directly when sscg_en is nonzero
  - sscg1: sets SSCG1 register directly when sscg_en is nonzero
  Note that for most applications, the PLL can be used with sscg_en set to 0.
  In this mode, the PLL operates like a fractional PLL, with the following
  output equation: (input_clock * (mdec / ndec))
