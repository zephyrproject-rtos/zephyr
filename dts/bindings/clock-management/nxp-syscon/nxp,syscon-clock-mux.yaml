      Tuple containing address of register and width of the bitfield
      to set to set the multiplexer selection

  input-sources:
    type: phandles
    required: true
    description: |
      List of all input sources provided to the multiplexer. These sources
      should be references to other clock nodes within the clock tree.

  offset:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Offset of bitfield within register to set to configure multiplexer

  safe-mux:
    type: boolean
