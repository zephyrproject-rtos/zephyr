  clock-ranking:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Ranking value for this clock, used when clock set rate features are
      enabled. By default this value is set to 0, the highest possible
      rank. If two clocks can both satisfy a given request, the one with the
      lower rank will be selected.
  clock-rank-factor:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Ranking factor for this clock, used when clock set rate features are
      enabled. This value is multiplied by the requested rate to
      determine the effective rate for ranking purposes. By default this
      value is set to 1, meaning the effective rate is the same as the
      requested rate.
