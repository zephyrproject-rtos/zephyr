        Power pin
        This pin defaults to active high when consumed by the SD card. The
        property value should ensure the flags properly describe the signal
        that is presented to the driver.

        Detect pin
        This pin defaults to active low when produced by the SD card. The
        property value should ensure the flags properly describe the signal
        that is presented to the driver.

    no-1-8-v:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: |
        When the external SD card circuit does not support 1.8V, add this
        property to disable 1.8v card voltage of SD card controller.

    detect-dat3:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: |
        Enable the host to detect an SD card via the DAT3 line of the SD card
        connection. Requires the board to define a function to pull DAT3 low or
        high using pullup/pulldown resistors.
