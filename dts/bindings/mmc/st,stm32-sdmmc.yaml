  bus-width:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
        bus width for SDMMC access, defaults to the minimum necessary
        number of bus lines
    enum:
      - 1
      - 4
      - 8

  clk-div:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
        Clock division factor for SDMMC. Typically the clock operates at 25MHz so
        a division factor of 2 would be 25MHz / 2 = 12.5MHz.

  idma:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      SDMMC device has an internal DMA. Internal DMA doesn't require any additional
      configuration using "dmas" property.
      Delete this property to use interrupt driven mode.

  dmas:
    description: |
      Optional DMA channel specifier. If DMA should be used, specifier should
      hold a phandle reference to the dma controller, the channel number,
      the slot number, channel configuration and finally features.

      Only priority bits are used in the configuration. There are no feature
      flags.

      For example dmas for TX/RX on SDMMC
         dmas = <&dma2 4 6 0x30000 0x00>, <&dma2 4 3 0x30000 0x00>;

  dma-names:
    description: |
      DMA channel name. If DMA should be used, expected value is "tx", "rx".

      For example
         dma-names = "tx", "rx";
