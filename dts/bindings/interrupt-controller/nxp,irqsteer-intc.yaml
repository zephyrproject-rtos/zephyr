      irq offset in isr table for an irqsteer instance.
      e.g There are 1000 irq entries(IRQ0-IRQ999) in isr table.
      IRQ0 - IRQ299 are level1 interrupts(direct interrupts).
      IRQ300 - IRQ500 are level2 interrupts from irqsteer instance 0.
      IRQ501 - IRQ999 are level2 interrupts from irqsteer instance 1.
      So for irqsteer instance 0, irq offset is 300.
      For irqsteer instance 1, irq offset is 501.

  nxp,num-irqs:
    required: true
    type: int
    description: |
      Totoal number of second level interrupt numbers supported by an irqsteer instance.
      e.g. In i.MX943,
      For irqsteerm7, irqsteera55 and irqsteerm33, there are 15 output masters
      (some masters are reserved). 64 input interrupts are connected to one output
      master. So the second level interrupt numbers are 64 x 15 = 960.
