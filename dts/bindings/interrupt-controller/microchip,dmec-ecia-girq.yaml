    description: |
      Many DEC/MEC periperals interrupt signals are direct capable. The signals are
      connected to bits in a GIRQ. Each GIRQ is composed of 5 32-bit registers:
      status(latched or r/w1-c), set-enable, clr-enable, and result (read-only).
      The read-only result register bits are the bitwise AND of status and enable.
      Direct mode routes the individual result register bits to NVIC inputs. If
      direct mode is disable by setting direct mode bit to 0 in the EC subsystem
      interrupt control register then the result register outputs are OR'd together
      and the OR'd result is connected to an NVIC input based on GIRQ number.
      To enable an interrupt a driver must know:
      a. NVIC input number and priority from the interrupts property
      b. GIRQ number and bit position from the girqs property
      The number of entries in interrupts and girqs should be the same in a DT node.
