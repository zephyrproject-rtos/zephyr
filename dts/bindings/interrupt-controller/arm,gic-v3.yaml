  ARM Generic Interrupt Controller v3

  Examples for GICv3 devicetree nodes:

      compatible = "arm,gic-v3", "arm,gic";
      reg = <0x2f000000 0x10000>,  /* GICD */
            <0x2f100000 0x200000>;  /* GICR */
      interrupt-controller;
      #interrupt-cells = <3>;
      status = "okay";
    };

    gic: interrupt-controller@2c010000 {
      compatible = "arm,gic-v3", "arm,gic";
      redistributor-stride = <0x40000>;  /* 256kB stride */
      redistributor-regions = <2>;
      reg = <0x2c010000 0x10000>,  /* GICD */
            <0x2d000000 0x800000>,  /* GICR 1: CPUs 0-31 */
            <0x2e000000 0x800000>;  /* GICR 2: CPUs 32-63 */

properties:
  redistributor-stride:
    type: int
    description:
      If using padding pages, specifies the stride of consecutive
      redistributors which is the distance between consecutive redistributors in
      memory. Must be a multiple of 64kB. Required if the distance between
      redistributors is not the default 128kB.

  redistributor-regions:
    type: int
    description:
      The number of independent contiguous regions occupied by the redistributors.
      The term "regions" refers to distinct memory segments or areas allocated
      for redistributors within the system memory. The number of redistributor
      regions and their sizes are hardware-specific. Required if more than one
      such region is present.
