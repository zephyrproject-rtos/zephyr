      Interrupt filter clock prescaler. The prescaler is applied to the input
      clock to SIUL2, which is the peripheral clock counter in the SIUL2.
      The prescaled filter clock period is:
        TIRC * (IFCP + 1)
      where:
        * TIRC is the internal oscillator period.
        * IFCP is 0 to 15.

    NXP SIUL2 External Interrupt configuration. Specific filter requirements
    for each interrupt can be specified by adding a child node to the interrupt
    controller, labeled `irq_<interrupt-number>`. For example:

      irq_0: irq_0 {
          max-filter-counter = <5>;
      };

    This will enable a digital filter counter on the corresponding interrupt
    pads to filter out glitches on the inputs. The digital filter will be
    disabled for interrupt lines without specified configuration node.

      type: int
      required: true

        Maximum Interrupt Filter Counter setting. This value configures the
        filter counter associated with the digital glitch filter.
        A value of 0 to 2, sets the filter as an all pass filter.
        A value of 3 to 15, sets the filter period to (TCK * MAXCNT + n * TCK),
        where:
          * n can be in the range 0 to 4, and accounts for the uncertainty
            factor in filter period calculation.
          * TCK is the prescaled filter clock period.
