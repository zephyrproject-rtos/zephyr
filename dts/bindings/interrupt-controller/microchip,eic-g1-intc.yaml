  Microchip External Interrupt Controller for g1 peripherals

  Group g1 EIC driver supports following hardware peripherals:
    - module name="EIC" id="U2254" version="3.0.0"

compatible: "microchip,eic-g1-intc"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  reg:
    required: true
    description: |
      Specifies the base address and size of the register
      block for the watchdog timer.

  interrupts:
    required: true
    description: |
      Specifies the interrupt line in the NVIC

  low-power-mode:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enables low power mode for eic peripheral

  porta-unsupported-pins:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Each bit in the property denotes a pin number. This shows the pins which
      does not support interrupt for port a.

  portb-unsupported-pins:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Each bit in the property denotes a pin number. This shows the pins which
      does not support interrupt for portb.

  portc-unsupported-pins:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Each bit in the property denotes a pin number. This shows the pins which
      does not support interrupt for portc.

  portd-supported-pins:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Each bit in the property denotes a pin number. This shows the pins which
      support interrupt in portd

  portb-special-pins-1:
    type: array
    default: [0, 0]
    description: |
      Each bit in this number denotes a pin number. These pins are derived from datasheet
      by listing down the eic line and port-pin mapping.
      The eic line mapping to the pin number requires a manipulation with an offset.

    type: int
    default: 2
    description: |
      Number of cells in portb-special-pins-1 property

  portc-special-pins-1:
    type: array
    default: [0, 0]
    description: |
      Each bit in this number denotes a pin number. These pins are derived from datasheet
      The eic line mapping to the pin number requires a manipulation with an offset.

    type: int
    default: 2
    description: |
      Number of cells in portc-special-pins-1 property

  portd-special-pins-1:
    type: array
    default: [0, 0]
    description: |
      Each bit in this number denotes a pin number. These pins are derived from datasheet
      The eic line mapping to the pin number requires a manipulation with an offset.
