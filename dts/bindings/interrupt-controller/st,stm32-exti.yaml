      Description of the input lines range for each interrupt line supported
      by the external interrupt controller. For each line a couple of integers is
      provided: the number of the first line of the range start and the length
      of the range.
      As example:
             line-ranges = <0 1>, <1 1>, <2 1>, <3 1>,
                           <4 1>, <5 5>, <10 6>;
      Above property provides event-range for 7 lines.
      5 first lines contain one element
      6th line starts with input line 5 and contains 5 elements (5 to 9)
      7th line starts with inupt line 10 and contains 6 elements (10 to 15)
