  VPR coprocessor

  VPR is a RISC-V CPU implementation. VPR instances are exposed to other CPUs as
  peripherals.

include: [base.yaml, pinctrl-device.yaml]

properties:
  execution-memory:
    type: phandle
    description: |
      Memory area from which the VPR code will execute.
      If not specified, the VPR coprocessor will not be launched automatically
      by the nordic_vpr_launcher driver when the node is enabled. In such case,
      the launching is supposed to be done explicitly by the user code, in some
      custom way presumably.

  source-memory:
    type: phandle
    description: |
      Memory area or partition from which the VPR code will be loaded.
