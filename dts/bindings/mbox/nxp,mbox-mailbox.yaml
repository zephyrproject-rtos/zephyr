  NXP Mailbox Unit as Zephyr MBOX.

  This NXP Mailbox driver implements Multi-Channel Inter-Processor Mailbox (MBOX) API
  around NXP Inter-CPU Mailbox peripheral IP block.

  The NXP Inter-CPU Mailbox provides up to thirty-two user defined interrupts.
  This driver uses 4 interrupts for mbox signalling mode per each channel,
  4 interrupts for mxbox data transfer mode per each channel and 24 as 3 bytes
  for data.

compatible: "nxp,mbox-mailbox"

include: [base.yaml, mailbox-controller.yaml]

    required: true

    type: int
    enum: [1, 2, 3, 4]

      Number of receive channels enabled on this instance.
      Setting this value to N, will enable channels 0 to N-1, consecutively.
      It should be set by the receiver core coupled with this Mailbox instance.

      For example, if receiver A wants to Rx on channels 0 to 3, then A must
      set rx-channels of mailbox as follows:

        mbox {
          rx-channels = <4>;
          status = "okay";
        };

mbox-cells:
  - channel
