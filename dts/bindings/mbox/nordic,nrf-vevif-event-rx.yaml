  Nordic VEVIF (VPR Event Interface) - EVENT RX MODE

  VEVIF provides support for inter-domain software signaling. It implements a set of events
  intended for signaling within the interprocessor communication (IPC) framework.
  When used in the event rx mode, the VEVIF events are used to receive IRQs that are
  triggered by the VPR core.

  Example definition:

    cpuppr_vpr: vpr@deadbeef {
      ...
      cpuflpr_vevif_event_rx: mailbox@0 {
        compatible = "nordic,nrf-vevif-event-rx";
        reg = <0x0 0x1000>;
        interrupts = <76 NRF_DEFAULT_IRQ_PRIORITY>;
        #mbox-cells = <1>;
        nordic,events = <1>;
        nordic,events-mask = <0x00008000>;
      };
    };

compatible: "nordic,nrf-vevif-event-rx"
