  Nordic BELLBOARD

  BELLBOARD provides support for inter-domain software signaling. It implements
  a set of tasks and events intended for signaling within an interprocessor
  communication (IPC) framework. When used in the rx mode, the BELLBOARD
  instance is used to receive events triggered by other remote cores.

  Example definition:

    bellboard: mailbox@deadbeef {
      compatible = "nordic,nrf-bellboard-rx";
      reg = <0xdeadbeef 0x1000>;
      interrupts = <98 NRF_DEFAULT_IRQ_PRIORITY>,
                   <99 NRF_DEFAULT_IRQ_PRIORITY>;
      interrupt-names = "irq2", "irq3";
      nordic,interrupt-mapping = <0x0000000f 2>, <0x000000f0 3>;
      #mbox-cells = <1>;
    };

compatible: "nordic,nrf-bellboard-rx"

include: "nordic,nrf-bellboard-common.yaml"

properties:
  interrupts:
    required: true

  interrupt-names:

  nordic,interrupt-mapping:

      Set of interrupt mapping pairs. Each pair consists of a bitmask and an
      interrupt identifier. The bitmask is used to indicate which of the 32
      possible events are mapped to the given interrupt. For example, given
      <0x0000000f 2>, the first four events are mapped to interrupt 2
      (irq2).
