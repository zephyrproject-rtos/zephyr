        Designate which type of coredump device this will be.
        A device of type COREDUMP_TYPE_MEMCPY can directly memcpy the provided memory-regions
        into the coredump. The memory-regions array can contain 0 or more entries, and more
        regions can be added at runtime through the coredump_device_register_memory API.
        A device of type COREDUMP_TYPE_CALLBACK must specify exactly one entry in the
        memory-regions array with a size of 0 and a desired size. The coredump device will statically
        allocate a block of memory of the desired size and provide a callback with a pointer to
        that memory which will be invoked at the time of a dump. This allows a consumer to add data
        into the coredump that may not be directly accessible through a memcpy and/or provides an
        opportunity to manipulate data for inclusion in the dump. The coredump_device_register_memory
        API is not available for a device of this type.
      enum:
        - "COREDUMP_TYPE_MEMCPY"
        - "COREDUMP_TYPE_CALLBACK"
