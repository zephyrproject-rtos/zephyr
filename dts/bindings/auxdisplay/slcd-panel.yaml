  Segment LCD Panel Device

  Represents a SLCD(segment LCD) panel connected to an SLCD controller.
  The SLCD panel defines the characteristics of the display including
  segment type, how many positions of numbers, letters and icons, the
  front plane pins and back plane COMs used by this panel, and the
  multiplexing configuration.

include: auxdisplay-device.yaml

on-bus: slcd

properties:
  pin-list:
    type: array
    description: |
      The list of front plane pins used to control the segments/icons. Each pin
      number cannot exceed the slcd controller's total pin count minus 1.
      This is used to support one SLCD controller controlling multiple panels, since
      the pins that control different panels cannot overlap.
      For example, if the controller has 16 front plane pins  and controls 2 panels,
      the list can be <0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7> for one panel, and <8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15> for
      another.
      
  com-list:
    type: array
    description: |
      The list of back plane coms used to control the segments/icons. Each com
      number cannot exceed the slcd controller's total com count minus 1.
      This is used to support one SLCD controller controlling multiple panels, since
      the coms that control different panels cannot overlap.
      For example, if the controller has 8 back plane COMs and controls 2 panels, the
      com list can be <4 5 6 7> for one panel, and <0 1 2 3> for another.

  segment-pins:
    type: array
    description: |
      2-D array of the pins that controls each segment.

      Array dimensions: num-positions x num-segments
      For a 7-segment(segment A to G) display with 6 positions, array size
      is 6 x 7 = 42 elements

      Example: If segment A (first segment) of position 1 (zero based index) is
      controlled by pin 8 com 3, then the (1,0) element of this array is 8.

  segment-coms:
    type: array
    description: |
      2-D array of the coms that controls each segment.

      Array dimensions: num-positions x num-segments
      For a 7-segment(segment A to G) display with 6 positions, array size
      is 6 x 7 = 42 elements

      Example: If segment A (first segment) of position 1 (zero based index) is
      controlled by pin 8 com 3, then the (1,0) element of this array is 3.

  num-icons:
    type: int
    description: |
      Number of special icons or indicators on the display.
      Icons are individual segments that are not part of standard character positions.
      For example, a colon, decimal point, or status indicator would count as one icon.
      These icons are treated as custom characters.

  icon-pins:
    type: array
    description: |
      1-D array of the pins that controls each icon.

      Example: if icon 0 controlled by pin 15, COM4, the first element of
      this array is 15.

  icon-coms:
    type: array
    description: |
      1-D array of the coms that controls each icon.

      Example: if icon 0 controlled by pin 15, COM4, the first element of
      this array is 4.
