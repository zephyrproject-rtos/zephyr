  SparkFun SerLCD Dot Character VFD Controller/Driver IC

  Example:
    &i2c1 {
      serlcd@72 {
        compatible = "sparkfun,serlcd";
        reg = <0x72>;
        columns = <16>;
        rows = <2>;
        command-delay = <10>;
        special-command-delay = <50>;
      };
    };

compatible: "sparkfun,serlcd"

include: [auxdisplay-device.yaml, i2c-device.yaml]

properties:
  columns:
    type: int
    default: 16
    enum:
      - 16
      - 20

  rows:
    type: int
    default: 2
    enum:
      - 2
      - 4

  command-delay-ms:
    type: int
    default: 10
    description: |
      Delay in milliseconds (defaults to 10ms if not set) after a normal command was sent.
      The default value is based on the original SparkFun SerLCD library
      implementation which assumes 100 kbps I2C configuration. This value
      might require tweaking if using I2C at a higher bitrare and/or relativily
      high update frequency of the display.

  special-command-delay-ms:
    type: int
    default: 50
