  Common GPIO-driven 7-Segment Display

  A 7-segment display is a form of electronic display device for displaying
  decimal numerals that is an alternative to the more complex dot matrix
  displays. Seven-segment displays are widely used in digital clocks, electronic
  meters, basic calculators, and other electronic devices that display numerical
  information.

  This driver supports 7-segment displays driven by GPIOs, in a widely used
  circuit design either common anode or common cathode.

  In common anode design, digit-gpios and segment-gpios are configured as active
  high and active low respectively, meaning that the current flows from
  digit-gpios to segment-gpios. Vice versa for common cathode.

  Example:

  #include <zephyr/dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h>

  / {
          auxdisplay_0: digi-display {
                  compatible = "gpio-7-segment";
                  columns = <3>;
                  rows = <1>;
                  segment-gpios = <&gpio0 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>, /* A */
                                  <&gpio0 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>, /* B */
                                  <&gpio0 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>, /* C */
                                  <&gpio0 3 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>, /* D */
                                  <&gpio0 4 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>, /* E */
                                  <&gpio0 5 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>, /* F */
                                  <&gpio0 6 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>, /* G */
                                  <&gpio0 7 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>; /* DP */
                  digit-gpios = <&gpio1 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,  /* DIG1 */
                                <&gpio1 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,  /* DIG2 */
                                <&gpio1 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;  /* DIG3 */
                  refresh-period-ms = <1>;
          };
  };

      GPIOs used to control the segments.

      Segments are usually labeled A to G, and DP for the decimal point. The
      GPIOs must be listed in the order A, B, C, D, E, F, G and an optional DP.
      The following diagram shows the segment layout:

           -- A --
          |       |
          F       B
          |       |
           -- G --
          |       |
          E       C
          |       |
           -- D --  (DP)

      The number of GPIOs must be 7 for a 7-segment display, or 8 for a 7-segment
      display with a decimal point.

  digit-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      GPIOs used to control the digits (the common anodes or cathodes).

      The number of GPIOs must match the number of digits.

  refresh-period-ms:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      The refresh period in milliseconds.

      This is the time between the display of each digit. The refresh period
      must be long enough to allow the segments to be driven and the digit to
      be selected.
