  Input driver for STM32 Tocuh Sensing Controller (TSC).

  This node is a st,stm32-tsc grandchild node and applies filters and
  calculations to detect an input event on a group which is the child of
  st,stm32-tsc. For more information see drivers/misc/st,stm32-tsc.yaml

  Example:

  #include <dt-bindings/input/input-event-codes.h>

  &tsc {
    compatible = "st,stm32-tsc";

    tsc_group6: g6 {
      ...
      ts1 {
        compatible = "tsc-keys";
        sampling-interval-ms = <10>;
        oversampling = <10>;
        noise-threshold = <50>;
        zephyr,code = <INPUT_KEY_0>;
      };
    };
  };

compatible: "tsc-keys"

include:
  - name: base.yaml
    property-allowlist:
      - compatible
      - zephyr,deferred-init
      - label
      - status

properties:
  sampling-interval-ms:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Sampling interval in milliseconds.
  oversampling:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Over sampling factor. The driver will take the average of the samples
      taken in the sampling interval and compare it with the previous sample.
      Larger values will reduce the noise but will increase the latency. The
      default value is 10 so the slope will be calculated every
      10 * sampling-interval-ms milliseconds.
  noise-threshold:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      This value will be used to reject the noise for both
      directions of the slope.
  sticky-key-timeout-ms:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Time in milliseconds to wait before releasing a key. By default a release
      event will be generated after 10 seconds of the last press event if
      the key is still pressed.
  zephyr,code:
    type: int
    required: true
