description: Microchip CAP12xx family of 3, 6 and 8-channel capacitive touch sensors.

compatible: "microchip,cap12xx"

include: i2c-device.yaml

properties:
  int-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Interrupt GPIO when not using polling mode.

  repeat:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Property to enable the interrupt repeat mode for prolonged touch events.

  poll-interval-ms:
    type: int
    default: 10
    description: |
      Polling interval in ms when not using interrupt mode.

  input-codes:
    type: array
    required: true
    description: |
      Array of input event key codes (INPUT_KEY_* or INPUT_BTN_*).

  sensor-gain:
    type: int
    enum:
      - 1
      - 2
      - 4
      - 8
    default: 1
    description: |
      Defines the gain of the sensor circuitry. This
      effectively controls the sensitivity, as a
      smaller delta capacitance is required to
      generate the same delta count values.

  sensitivity-delta-sense:
    type: int
    enum: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128]
    default: 32
    description:
      Controls the sensitivity multiplier of a touch detection.
      Higher value means more sensitive settings.
      At the more sensitive settings, touches are detected for a smaller delta
      capacitance corresponding to a "lighter" touch.

  signal-guard:
    type: array
    enum: [0, 1]
    default: [0, 0, 0]
    description: |
      0 - off
      1 - on
      The signal guard isolates the signal from virtual grounds.
      If enabled then the behavior of the channel is changed to signal guard.
      The number of entries must correspond to the number of channels.

  calib-sensitivity:
    type: array
    enum: [1, 2, 4]
    default: [1, 1, 1]
    description: |
      Specifies an array of numeric values that controls the gain
      used by the calibration routine to enable sensor inputs
      to be more sensitive for proximity detection.
      Gain is based on touch pad capacitance range
      1 - 5-50pF
      2 - 0-25pF
      4 - 0-12.5pF
      The number of entries must correspond to the number of channels.
