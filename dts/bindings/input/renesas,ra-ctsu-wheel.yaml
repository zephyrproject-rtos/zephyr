  Renesas RA Capacitive Touch Wheel

  This node is a renesas,ra-ctsu grandchild node and applies filters and calculations
  to detect an input event on a group which is the child of renesas,ra-ctsu.
  For more information see input/renesas,ra-ctsu.yaml

  Example:

  #include <dt-bindings/input/input-event-codes.h>

  &ctsu {
    compatible = "renesas,ra-ctsu";

    group1 {
      ...
      wheel {
        compatible = "renesas,ra-ctsu-wheel";
        elements = <0>, <3>, <2>, <1>;
        threshold = <711>;
        event-code = <INPUT_ABS_WHEEL>;
      };
    };
  };

compatible: "renesas,ra-ctsu-wheel"

include: [base.yaml]
