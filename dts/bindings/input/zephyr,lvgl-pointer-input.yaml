  LVGL pointer indev pseudo-device

  Listens for touch input events and routes the
  lv_indev_data_t to the underlying pointer lv_indev_t managed by LVGL.

  Needs to be associated to a specific device to listen for events
  from that device. Example configuration:

  pointer {
          compatible = "zephyr,lvgl-pointer-input";
          input = <&input_sdl_touch>;
  };

compatible: "zephyr,lvgl-pointer-input"

include: zephyr,lvgl-common-input.yaml

properties:
