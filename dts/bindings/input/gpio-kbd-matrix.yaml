  GPIO based keyboard matrix input device

  Implement an input device for a GPIO based keyboard matrix.

  Example configuration:

  kbd-matrix {
          compatible = "gpio-kbd-matrix";
          row-gpios = <&gpio0 0 (GPIO_PULL_UP | GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW)>,
                      <&gpio0 1 (GPIO_PULL_UP | GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW)>;
          col-gpios = <&gpio0 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>,
                      <&gpio0 3 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>,
                      <&gpio0 4 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
          no-ghostkey-check;
  };

compatible: "gpio-kbd-matrix"

include:
  - name: kbd-matrix-common.yaml
    property-blocklist:
      - row-size
      - col-size

properties:
  row-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      GPIO for the keyboard matrix rows, up to 8 different GPIOs. All row GPIO
      pins must have interrupt support if idle-mode is set to "interrupt"
      (default).

  col-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      GPIO for the keyboard matrix columns, supports up to 32 different GPIOs.
      When unselected, this pin will be either driven to inactive state or
      configured to high impedance (input) depending on the col-drive-inactive
      property.

  col-drive-inactive:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If enabled, unselected column GPIOs will be driven to inactive state.
      Default to configure unselected column GPIOs to high impedance.

  idle-mode:
    type: string
    default: "interrupt"
    enum:
      - "interrupt"
      - "poll"
      - "scan"
    description: |
      Controls the driver behavior on idle, "interrupt" waits for a new key
      press using GPIO interrupts on the row lines, "poll"  periodically polls
      the row lines with all the columns selected, "scan" just keep scanning
      the matrix continuously, requires "poll-timeout-ms" to be set to 0.
