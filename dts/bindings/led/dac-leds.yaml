title: Group of DAC-controlled LEDs.

description: |
  Each LED is defined in a child node of the dac-leds node.

  Here is an example which defines an LED in the node /leds:

  / {
          leds {
                  compatible = "dac-leds";
                  led_0 {
                          dac-dev = <&dac1>;
                          channel = <0>;
                          resolution = <12>;
                  };
                  led_1 {
                          dac-dev = <&dac1>;
                          channel = <1>;
                          resolution = <12>;
                          voltage-min-brightness-mv = <1400>;
                          voltage-max-brightness-mv = <2700>;
                          voltage-max-dac-mv = <3300>;
                          output-buffer;
                  };
          };
  };

  Above:

  - led_0 uses dac1 channel 0 with 12 bit resolution.
  - led_1 uses dac1 channel 1 with 12 bit resolution and setup to supply an LED directly.

compatible: "dac-leds"

  description: DAC LED child node
  properties:
    dac-dev:
      type: phandle
      required: true
      description: |
        Property containing phandle to DAC e.g. &dac.

    channel:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        The DAC channel.

    resolution:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        The DAC resolution to use.

    voltage-min-brightness-mv:
      type: int
      description: |
        Voltage at brightness 0%.
        If not specified the minimum DAC output voltage is used.

    voltage-max-brightness-mv:
      type: int
      description: |
        Voltage at brightness 100%.
        If not specified the maximum DAC output voltage is used.

    voltage-max-dac-mv:
      type: int
      description: |
        The DAC maximum output voltage.
        Required if voltage-min-brightness-mv or voltage-max-brightness-mv is set.

    output-buffer:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Enable the output buffer of the DAC.
        This is required if it is used to drive an LED directly.
