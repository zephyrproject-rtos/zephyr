title: Combines several monochromatic LEDs into one multi-color LED.

description: |
  Here is an example that defines an RGB LED with a group of monochromatic
  PWM LEDs. Note that the pwms property definition handle depends on the PWM
  controller model. In this example, an STM32 PWM controller is assumed.

  #include <zephyr/dt-bindings/led/led.h>

  / {
          monochromatic-leds {
                  compatible = "pwm-leds";

                  red_pwm_led: led-0 {
                          pwms = <&pwm1 1 PWM_MSEC(20) PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL>;
                  };

                  green_pwm_led: led-1 {
                          pwms = <&pwm2 1 PWM_MSEC(20) PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL>;
                  };

                  blue_pwm_led: led-2 {
                          pwms = <&pwm3 1 PWM_MSEC(20) PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL>;
                  };
          };

          rgb-led {
                  compatible = "leds-group-multicolor";

                  leds = <&red_pwm_led>, <&green_pwm_led>, <&blue_pwm_led>;
                  color-mapping = <LED_COLOR_ID_RED>,
                                  <LED_COLOR_ID_GREEN>,
                                  <LED_COLOR_ID_BLUE>;
