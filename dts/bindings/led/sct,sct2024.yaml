    description:
      GPIO specifier for the LA (Latch) pin.
      The LA pin is used to apply previously transferred data to all LEDs simultaneously. When the
      LA pin is high, the LED outputs reflect the current contents of the shift register
      (transparent mode). When the LA pin is low, the current shift-register data is latched and
      held on the LED outputs until the next latch operation.

  oe-gpios:
    description:
      GPIO specifier for the OE (Output Enable) pin.
      The OE pin can be used to disable all LEDs connected to the device. When the OE pin is high,
      all LEDs are disabled.
