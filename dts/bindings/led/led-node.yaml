# Common fields for LED nodes

properties:
  label:
    type: string
    description: |
      Human readable string describing the LED. It can be used by an
      application to identify this LED or to retrieve its number/index
      (i.e. child node number) on the parent device.
  color-mapping:
    type: array
    description: |
      Channel to color mapping of a multicolor LED. If a LED supports
      several colors, then the color-mapping property can be used to
      describe how the hardware channels and the colors are mapped.

      For example the channel to color mapping of RGB LEDs would be

         color-mapping =
              <LED_COLOR_ID_RED>,
              <LED_COLOR_ID_GREEN>,
              <LED_COLOR_ID_BLUE>;
