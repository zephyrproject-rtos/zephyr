    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      The GP1 signal defaults to DEV_RDY as produced by the
      adc. The property value should ensure the flags properly
      describe the signal that is presented to the driver.

      The GP0 signal defaults to Disabled as produced by the

      Default ADC input range is 0V to Vref.
      This option increases the range from 0V to 2 x Vref. Note that this
      requires VDD >= 2 x Vref.
