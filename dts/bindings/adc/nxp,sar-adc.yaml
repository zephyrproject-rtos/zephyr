  NXP successive-approximation ADC (SAR ADC) controller.

compatible: "nxp,sar-adc"

include: [adc-controller.yaml]

properties:
  reg:
    required: true

  interrupts:
    required: true

  has-external-channels:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Indicates whether this SAR ADC instance supports the External channel group
      (group2: NCMR2/CEOCFR2/CIMR2/ECDR).
      Some SoCs expose different capabilities per ADC instance.

  overwrite:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable overwrite of conversion results when the result registers are full.

  auto-clock-off:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Reduces power consumption by turning off the clock of the analog part of
      ADC when it is in Idle state.

  hw-average-support:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Indicates whether the ADC hardware supports averaging of conversion results.

  conv-clk-freq-div-factor:
    type: int
    enum: [0, 1, 2, 3]
    description: |
      Select ADC conversion clock frequency division factor.
      ADC conversion clock = ADC module clock ÷ (1 << conv-clk-freq-div-factor)
      - 0: ADC module clock frequency
      - 1: ADC module clock frequency divided by 2
      - 2: ADC module clock frequency divided by 4
      - 3: ADC module clock frequency divided by 8
      NOTE: This property is not available on I.MX devices.
