title: PSOC C3 HPPASS SAR ADC

description: |
  Infineon PSOC C3 HPPASS SAR ADC

  The HPPASS (High Performance Programmable Analog Sub-System) SAR ADC
  provides high-resolution analog-to-digital conversion capabilities
  for the PSOC C3 family of microcontrollers.

  Each ADC channel corresponds to a dedicated analog input pin, except for
  the last four sampler inputs which are muxed.  See the device datasheet for
  pin assignments and mux options.

  Dependency: This ADC node must be a child of the HPPASS analog subsystem
  node ("infineon,hppass-analog"), which provides clock, power, and reference
  resources.

      Selects whether the ADC uses internal (true) or external (false) reference.
      External reference recommended for best performance.
