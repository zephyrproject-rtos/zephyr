      description: |
        Acquisition time for ADC sampling in ADCLK cycles (ticks).
        Only the ADC_ACQ_TIME_TICKS unit is supported on this device.
        The acquisition time value (in ticks) must be between 5 and 255.
        When ADC_ACQ_TIME_DEFAULT is specified, the hardware uses 11 ticks as the default
        acquisition time.
    zephyr,oversampling:
      description: |
        Oversampling setting to be used for the channel.
        When specified, each sample is averaged from 2^N conversion results
        (where N is the provided value).
        On this device, N = 0, 1, 2.
