      Enable the internal timer for the SAADC to improve interval accuracy.
      When enabled, the SAADC will utilize its built-in local timer for sampling.
      If disabled, the SAADC will rely on the kernel timer.
      WARNING: The internal timer is only applicable for sequences with a single channel.
               It can be used only for intervals between consecutive samplings ranging
               from 500 ns to 128 us.
