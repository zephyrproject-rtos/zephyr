    ADC channels exposed on Arduino Uno (R3) headers.

    The Arduino Uno layout provides a 6-pin Analog Input header.  This
    has analog input signals labeled from A0 at the top through A5 at
    the bottom.

    This binding provides a nexus mapping for these pins where parent
    pins 0 through 5 correspond to A0 through A5.
