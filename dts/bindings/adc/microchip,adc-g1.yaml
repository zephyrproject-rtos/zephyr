title: Microchip ADC G1 Driver

description: |
  Binding for the Microchip ADC driver supporting Group G1 peripherals.

  Group G1 ADC driver supports the following hardware peripheral:
    - module name="ADC" id="U2500" version="1.0.0"

compatible: "microchip,adc-g1"

include:
  - name: adc-controller.yaml
  - name: pinctrl-device.yaml

properties:
  reg:
    required: true
    description: |
      Register base address and size for the ADC peripheral.

  interrupts:
    required: true
    description: |
      Interrupt specifier for the ADC peripheral.

  clocks:
    required: true
    description: |
      Clock phandles used to drive the ADC.

  clock-names:
    required: true
    description: |
      Clock name corresponding to the `clocks` entry.

  prescaler:
    type: int
    required: true
    enum: [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256]
    description: |
      Clock prescaler value. Must be a power of 2 between 2 and 256 inclusive.

      The ADC clock is derived by dividing the source clock by this prescaler.

  num-channels:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Number of input channels supported by this ADC instance.

  "#io-channel-cells":
    const: 1
    description: |
      Specifies that each io-channel uses a single cell (input index).

  nvm-calib:
    type: phandle
    required: true
    description: |
      Phandle to the NVM software calibration area containing
      ADC factory calibration values.

  calib-mapping:
    type: array
    required: true
    description: |
      Calibration mapping entries describing how values are extracted
      from the NVM calibration area and programmed into the ADC CALIB
      register.

      Each entry consists of three cells in the form:
      <adc_bit nvm_bit mask>.

  calib-mapping-names:
    type: string-array
    description: |
      Names of ADC calibration fields corresponding one-to-one with
      the entries in calib-mapping.

io-channel-cells:
  - input
