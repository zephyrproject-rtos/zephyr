  Bindings for the ADI AD7124 Analog-to-Digital Converter.

compatible: adi,ad7124-adc

include: [adc-controller.yaml, spi-device.yaml]

properties:

  reference-enable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable internal reference for AD7124
      - true: Enable internal reference
      - false: Disable internal reference

  pd-switch-enable:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |
      Enable internal low side power switch for AD7124
      - true: The switch is in the open position
      - false: The switched is in the closed position
      The default configuration places the switch in the
      closed position for control setup upon power-up 
      or after reset.

  filter-type-mask:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Filter type for AD7124:
      Each bit set in this mask enables the filter type,
      with the 0th bit corresponding to the 0th channel,
      the 1st bit to the 1st channel, and so on.
      - 0 means AD7124_FILTER_SINC4
      - 1 means AD7124_FILTER_SINC3
      The default is set to 0 because the filter type is set to SINC4
      for all filter setups upon power-up or after reset.
      Therefore, this setting is considered the default for all channels.

  bipolar-mask:
    type: int
    default: 0xFFFF
    description: |
      Bipolar configuration for AD7124
      Each bit set in this mask enables the polarity,
      with the 0th bit corresponding to the 0th channel,
      the 1st bit to the 1st channel, and so on.
      - 0 Unipolar operation selection
      - 1 Bipolar operation selection
      The default is set to 0xFFFF because the bipolar configuration
      is activated for all configuration setups upon power-up or after reset.
      Therefore, this setting is considered the default for all channels.

  inbuf-enable-mask:
    type: int
    default: 0xFFFF
    description: |
      Input buffer configuration for AD7124
      Each bit set in this mask enables the input buffer,
      with the 0th bit corresponding to the 0th channel,
      the 1st bit to the 1st channel, and so on.
      - 0 Analog input pin is unbuffered
      - 1 Analog input pin is buffered
      The default is set to 0xFFFF because the analog input buffer
      is enabled for all configuration setups upon power-up or after reset.
      Therefore, this setting is considered the default for all channels.

  refbuf-enable-mask:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Reference buffer configuration for AD7124
      Each bit set in this mask enables the reference buffer,
      with the 0th bit corresponding to the 0th channel,
      the 1st bit to the 1st channel, and so on.
      - 0 Reference input pin is unbuffered
      - 1 Reference input pin is buffered
      The default is set to 0 because the reference input buffer
      is enabled for all configuration setups upon power-up or after reset.
      Therefore, this setting is considered the default for all channels.

  adc-mode:
    type: int
    enum: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    default: 0
    description: |
      ADC operating mode for AD7124
      - 0 AD7124_CONTINUOUS
      - 1 AD7124_SINGLE
      - 2 AD7124_STANDBY
      - 3 AD7124_POWER_DOWN
      - 4 AD7124_IDLE
      - 5 AD7124_IN_ZERO_SCALE_OFF
      - 6 AD7124_IN_FULL_SCALE_GAIN
      - 7 AD7124_SYS_ZERO_SCALE_OFF
      - 8 AD7124_SYS_ZERO_SCALE_GAIN
      The default is set to 0 because the continuous conversion mode
      is enabled for control setup upon power-up or after reset.

  power-mode:
    type: int
    enum: [0, 1, 2]
    default: 0
    description: |
      Power mode of the ADC for AD7124
      - 0 AD7124_LOW_POWER_MODE
      - 1 AD7124_MID_POWER_MODE
      - 2 AD7124_HIGH_POWER_MODE
      The default is set to 0 because the low power mode
      is enabled for control setup upon power-up or after reset.

  active-device:
    type: int
    enum: [0, 1]
    required: true
    description: |
      Active device for AD7124
      - 0 ID_AD7124_4
      - 1 ID_AD7124_8
