    description: |
      List of the resolutions supported by the ADC instance. They should be
      values created with STM32_ADC_RES macro or similar. Their order is not
      important. For example for STM32F4:
        <STM32_ADC_RES(12, 0x00) STM32_ADC_RES(10, 0x01)
         STM32_ADC_RES(8, 0x02)  STM32_ADC_RES(6, 0x03)>
      The two parameters are the resolution (for example 10 bits) and the
      corresponding register value (0x01 for a 10-bit resolution).
      By design, these macros also contains all register information (address,
      field offset and field mask) necessary to properly set the resolution.
