      GPIO for data ready signal.
      This pin becomes active low when a conversion result is ready
      for reading.
      (Note: DRDY/DOUT pin is currently only used as DOUT.)

      IDAC current magnitude in microamperes.
      Both IDACs share the same current magnitude setting.

  pga-bypass:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Bypass the programmable gain amplifier (PGA).
      When enabled, the PGA is bypassed and the gain is fixed at 1.
      This can reduce noise and power consumption for high-level signals.

    enum:  # Normal Mode | Duty-Cycle Mode | Turbo Mode
      - 0  # 20 SPS      | 5 SPS           | 40 SPS

      Data rate setting (samples per second).
      Higher data rates provide faster conversions but may reduce
      noise performance.
      This corresponds with the zephyr,acquisition-time.

  operating-mode:
    type: int
    enum:
      - 0  # Normal mode (256kHz modulator)
      - 1  # Duty-cycle mode
      - 2  # Turbo mode (512kHz modulator)
    default: 0
    description: |
      These bits control the operating mode the device operates in.
      - Normal: Standard operation with 256kHz modulator
      - Duty-cycle: Power-saving mode with reduced current
      - Turbo: High-speed mode with 512kHz modulator

  continuous-convert:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      This feature is currently not implemented!
      In continuous conversion mode, the device continuously performs
      conversions. When a conversion completes, the device places the result
      in the output buffer and immediately begins another conversion.
