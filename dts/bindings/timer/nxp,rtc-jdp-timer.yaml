  NXP RTC JDP (RTC_JDP) used as a Zephyr system timer timebase.

compatible: "nxp,rtc-jdp-timer"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  reg:
    required: true

  interrupts:
    required: true

  clock-frequency:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Frequency, in Hz, of the selected RTC clock source before prescaling.

  clock-source:
    type: int
    required: true
    enum:
      - 0
      - 1
      - 2
      - 3
    description: |
      Select the RTC clock source (chip-specific mux). No binding-wide default
      is provided because the hardware reset default differs by SoC. The SoC
      dtsi must set this to the correct value for each instance.

  prescaler:
    type: int
    default: 1
    enum:
      - 1
      - 32
      - 512
      - 16384
    description: |
      Divider for the RTC clock source. Supported divide values are 1, 32, 512,
      or 16384.
