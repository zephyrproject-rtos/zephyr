    This is a representation of the Andes Technology atcpit100 PIT node

compatible: "andestech,atcpit100"

include: base.yaml

properties:
    reg:
      required: true

    interrupts:
      required: true

    clock-frequency:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: channel clock source

    prescaler:
      type: int
      default: 1
      required: false
      description: |
        The prescaler value defines the counter frequency
        (clock-frequency/prescaler) in atcpit100 counter driver, the prescaler
        value could be in range [1 .. clock-frequency] and 1 means no prescaler
        for the PIT clock-frequency.

        Defaults to 1 to use the PIT clock-frequency as the counter frequency.

        Setting the prescaler value if the system overhead is close to or
        larger than a counter tick period, reducing the counter frequency to
        avoid imprecise counter value.

        For example, andes_v5_ae350 platform takes about 200 ~ 300 PIT
        clock cycles for counter interface, setting prescaler value to 600 in
        this case.
