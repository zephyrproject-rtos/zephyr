      Clock prescaler at the input of the timer
      Could be in range [0 .. 0xFFFF] for STM32 General Purpose Timers (CLK/(prescaler+1) )

  st,countermode:
    type: int
    default: 0 # STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_UP - reset state
    description: |
      Sets timer counter mode.

      Use constants defined in dt-bindings/timer/stm32-timer.h.

      * STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_UP             - used as upcounter.
      * STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_DOWN           - used as downcounter.
      * STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_CENTER_DOWN    - counts up and down alternatively.
                                               Output compare interrupt flags of output channels
                                               are set only when the counter is counting down.
      * STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_CENTER_UP      - counts up and down alternatively.
                                               Output compare interrupt flags of output channels
                                               are set only when the counter is counting up.
      * STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_CENTER_UP_DOWN - counts up and down alternatively.
                                               Output compare interrupt flags of output channels
                                               are set only when the counter is counting up or
                                               down.

      If absent, then STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_UP is used (reset state).

  st,deadtime:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Sets the dead-time configuration on the associated timer which will add
      a delay between the rising edge of the reference signal and the rising
      edge of both the OCx and OCxN signals. This is commonly used and required
      with bridge circuits to prevent shoot-through currents.

      This feature is supported only by certain timer instances. Refer
      to your product's Reference Manual for more information about this
      feature's availability. (In particular, certain series such as
      STM32L0/STM32L1 have no instance supporting this feature).

      Valid range [0 ... 255].
