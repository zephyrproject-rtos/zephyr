      Clock prescaler at the input of the timer
      Could be in range [0 .. 0xFFFF] for STM32 General Purpose Timers (CLK/(prescaler+1) )

  st,countermode:

    description: |
      Sets timer counter mode.

      Use constants defined in dt-bindings/timer/stm32-timer.h.

      * STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_UP             - used as upcounter.
      * STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_DOWN           - used as downcounter.
      * STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_CENTER_DOWN    - counts up and down alternatively.
                                               Output compare interrupt flags of output channels
                                               are set only when the counter is counting down.
      * STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_CENTER_UP      - counts up and down alternatively.
                                               Output compare interrupt flags of output channels
                                               are set only when the counter is counting up.
      * STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_CENTER_UP_DOWN - counts up and down alternatively.
                                               Output compare interrupt flags of output channels
                                               are set only when the counter is counting up or
                                               down.

      If absent, then STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_UP is used (reset state).

  st,mastermode:
    type: string
    default: RESET
    enum:
      - RESET
      - ENABLE
      - UPDATE
      - CC1IF
      - OC1REFC
      - OC2REFC
      - OC3REFC
      - OC4REFC
    description: |
      Sets the master mode.
      Only available for timer instances with master function.

      For details refer to the reference manual of your device.

      Use constants defined in dt-bindings/timer/stm32-timer.h.

      * RESET   - Update event is used as trigger output (TRGO).
      * ENABLE  - Uses counter enable signal as trigger output (TRGO).
      * UPDATE  - Uses update event as trigger output (TRGO).
      * CC1IF   - Uses CC1IF flag as pulse source for TRGO outout.
      * OC1REFC - OC1REFC signal is used as trigger output (TRGO).
      * OC2REFC - OC2REFC signal is used as trigger output (TRGO).
      * OC3REFC - OC3REFC signal is used as trigger output (TRGO).
      * OC4REFC - OC4REFC signal is used as trigger output (TRGO).
