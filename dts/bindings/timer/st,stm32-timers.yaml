          Sets timer counter mode.

          Use constants defined in dt-bindings/timer/stm32-timer.h.

          * STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_UP             - used as upcounter.
          * STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_DOWN           - used as downcounter.
          * STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_CENTER_DOWN    - counts up and down alternatively.
                                                   Output compare interrupt flags of output channels
                                                   are set only when the counter is counting down.
          * STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_CENTER_UP      - counts up and down alternatively.
                                                   Output compare interrupt flags of output channels
                                                   are set only when the counter is counting up.
          * STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_CENTER_UP_DOWN - counts up and down alternatively.
                                                   Output compare interrupt flags of output channels
                                                   are set only when the counter is counting up or down.

          If absent, then STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_UP is used (reset state).
