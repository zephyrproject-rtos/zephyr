      Clock prescaler at the input of the timer
      Could be in range [0 .. 0xFFFF] for STM32 General Purpose Timers (CLK/(prescaler+1) )

  st,countermode:
    type: int
    default: 0 # STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_UP - reset state
    description: |
      Sets timer counter mode.

      Use constants defined in dt-bindings/timer/stm32-timer.h.

      * STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_UP             - used as upcounter.
      * STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_DOWN           - used as downcounter.
      * STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_CENTER_DOWN    - counts up and down alternatively.
                                               Output compare interrupt flags of output channels
                                               are set only when the counter is counting down.
      * STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_CENTER_UP      - counts up and down alternatively.
                                               Output compare interrupt flags of output channels
                                               are set only when the counter is counting up.
      * STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_CENTER_UP_DOWN - counts up and down alternatively.
                                               Output compare interrupt flags of output channels
                                               are set only when the counter is counting up or
                                               down.

      If absent, then STM32_TIM_COUNTERMODE_UP is used (reset state).

  st,deadtime:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Sets the dead-time configuration in the Break and Dead-Time register (BDTR)
      for the associated timer to prevent shoot-through currents in bridge
      circuits.
      Valid range [0 ... 255].
