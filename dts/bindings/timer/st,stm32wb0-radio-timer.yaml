properties:
  compensated-timer-freq:
    type: int
    required: true
    const: 409600
    description: |
      Timer frequency resulting from LSI or LSE frequency with interpolated value from HSE with
      a periodic temperature compensation algorithm.
      It is independent of hardware oscillator variations due to temperature.
      The timer resolution is equivalent to 625/256 μs (approximately 2.4414 μs).
      The value is expressed in hertz (Hz).

  max-hs-startup-time:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      High speed crystal startup time. This is used by hardware to anticipate wake-up event
      so that high speed crystal is ready at the desired time. This parameter depends on the board
      and the crystal used. It is expressed in the unit of 625/256 μs (approximately 2.4414 μs).
      For example, if the property is set to 320, it means approximately 781 μs are needed.
