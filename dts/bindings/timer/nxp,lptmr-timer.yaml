properties:
  reg:
    required: true

  interrupts:
    required: true

  clock-frequency:

  prescaler:

    description: |
      This property has been deprecated and replaced by prescale-glitch-filter.
      It no longer has any functional impact. Any value assigned to this property
      will be disregarded. Consequently, the prescaler will be bypassed.

  clk-source:
    type: int
    required: true
    enum: [0, 1, 2, 3]
    description: |
      Selects the clock to be used by the LPMTR prescaler/glitch filter.
      In time counter mode, this field selects the input clock to the prescaler.
      In pulse counter mode, this field selects the input clock to the glitch filter.
      The clock connections vary by device, see the device reference manual for
      more details.

  prescale-glitch-filter:
    type: int
    default: 0
    enum: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
    description: |
      Configures the size of the prescaler in Time Counter mode and the width of the
      glitch filter in Pulse Counter mode.

  resolution:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Represents the width of the timer in bits.
