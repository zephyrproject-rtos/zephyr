        Timer / Counter channel to use, channel 0 is the default.
        Valid range: 0 - 2

    clk:

        Clock source selection as defined by TCCLKS bit-field of TC_CMR
        register. Consult the datasheet for the details.

      required: false
      description: |
        If set to true the `clk` property is ignored. Instead the TC module is
        driven directly via MCLK. Only supported on sam4e, same70, same70b,
        samv71, samv71b SoC series.

        Alternate value of the CMR (Channel Mode Register) register.
        If specified this value will be written to the register during driver
        instance initialization instead of the default. It can be used to
        configure the timer / counter in the custom mode. Together with other
        properties like channel-num, pinctrl-0 this allows e.g. to configure
        the driver to count events generated on the TIOA, TIOB signal connected
        to the external pin.

    reg-rc:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        Register C compare/match value. RC can be used as compare/match unit
        for an specific timer unit. Their use depends on how timer channel
        is configured,see reg-cmr. It can be used as trigger for both input
        capture or counter mode, or even as event source. The RC register
        behavior is SoC dependent. For more information and use cases,
        check SoC datasheet and application notes.
