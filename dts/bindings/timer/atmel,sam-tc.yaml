        Timer / Counter channel to use, channel 0 is the default.
        Valid range: 0 - 2

    clk:

      description: |
        Clock source selection as defined by TCCLKS bit-field of TC_CMR
        register. Consult the datasheet for the details.

    nodivclk:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: |
        If set to true the `clk` property is ignored. Instead the TC module is
        driven directly via MCLK. Only supported on sam4e, same70, same70b,
        samv71, samv71b SoC series.

    reg-cmr:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        Alternate value of the CMR (Channel Mode Register) register.
        If specified this value will be written to the register during driver
        instance initialization instead of the default. It can be used to
        configure the timer / counter in the custom mode. Together with other
        properties like channel-num, pinctrl-0 this allows e.g. to configure
        the driver to count events generated on the TIOA, TIOB signal connected
        to the external pin.

    pinctrl-0:
      type: phandles
      required: false
      description: |
        PIO pin configuration for Timer Counter signals.  We expect that
        the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes.  These nodes will
        have a nodelabel that matches the Atmel SoC HAL defines and
        be of the form p<port><pin><periph>_<inst>_<signal>.

        For example the TC0 on SAME7x would be
           pinctrl-0 = <&pa0b_tc0_tioa0 &pa1b_tc0_tiob0>;
