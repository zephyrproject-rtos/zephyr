    description: |
      Counter maximum value. The SoC contains multiple instances
      of the basic timer. Some are 16-bit, others 32-bit.

  prescaler:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Basic timer implements a 16-bit clock prescale value.
      Count frequency is clock-frequency divided by (prescaler + 1).
