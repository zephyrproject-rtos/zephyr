child-binding:
  description: |
    Each child node defines the configuration of a SENT channel

  properties:
    reg:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: Channel identifier.

    num-data-nibbles:
      type: int
      enum:
        - 1
        - 2
        - 3
        - 4
        - 5
        - 6
        - 7
        - 8
      required: true
      description: |
        Specifies the number of data nibbles. A nibble is a four-bit aggregation.
        This property defines how many such nibbles are used in the data transmission.

    clock-tick-length-us:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        Specifies the clock tick length in microseconds (us). This value determines the
        base time unit for the system's timing operations, effectively setting the resolution
        of the timer.

    successive-calib-pulse-method:
      type: int
      required: true
      enum:
        - 1
        - 2
      description: |
        Specifies the successive calibration pulse check method options.
        Option 1 is the preferred high-latency method, while option 2 provides
        a low-latency alternative.

    calib-pulse-tolerance-percent:
      type: int
      required: true
      enum:
        - 20
        - 25
      description: |
        Specifies the acceptable calibration pulse tolerance. The available options are
        20% and 25%.

    pause-pulse-detect:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Indicates whether the channel is enabled to detect a pause pulse.

    fast-crc:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        Specifies the fast message CRC configurations is applied when calculating the CRC.
        Allowed value combinations are defined in dt-bindings/sent/sent.h:
        - FAST_CRC_DISABLE
        - FAST_CRC_RECOMMENDED_IMPLEMENTATION
        - FAST_CRC_LEGACY_IMPLEMENTATION
        - FAST_CRC_RECOMMENDED_IMPLEMENTATION | FAST_CRC_STATUS_INCLUDE
        - FAST_CRC_LEGACY_IMPLEMENTATION | FAST_CRC_STATUS_INCLUDE

    short-serial-crc:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        Specifies the short serial message CRC configurations is applied when calculating the CRC.
        Allowed values are defined in dt-bindings/sent/sent.h:
        - SHORT_CRC_RECOMMENDED_IMPLEMENTATION
        - SHORT_CRC_LEGACY_IMPLEMENTATION
