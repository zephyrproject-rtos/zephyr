      Number of items to expect in a PWM
      - channel of the timer used for PWM
      - period to set in ns
      - flags : combination of standard flags like PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL
        or specific flags like STM32_PWM_COMPLEMENTARY. As an example for channel2:
         <&pwm1 2 100 (PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL | STM32_PWM_COMPLEMENTARY)>;

pwm-cells:
  - channel
  - period
  - flags
