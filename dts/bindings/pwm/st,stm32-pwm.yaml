        Clock prescaler at the input of the timer
        Note: This property is obsolete and was replaced by "st,prescaler"
        binding of parent timer node. It is kept temporarily for compatibility
        reasons.

        Number of items to expect in a PWM
        - channel of the timer used for PWM
        - period to set in ns
        - flags : combination of standard flags like PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL
          or specific flags like PWM_STM32_COMPLEMENTARY. As an example for channel2:
           <&pwm1 2 100 (PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL | PWM_STM32_COMPLEMENTARY)>;

pwm-cells:
  - channel
  - period
  - flags
