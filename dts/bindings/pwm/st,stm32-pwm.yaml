    description: |
      Add support to capture on four channels. This is less accurate than
      the default 2 channel support because the counter is reset by
      interrupt instead of slave-mode controller. This option can also
      be used as alternative for timers that does not support slave mode.

      Number of items to expect in a PWM
      - channel of the timer used for PWM
      - period to set in ns
      - flags : combination of standard flags like PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL
        or specific flags like STM32_PWM_COMPLEMENTARY. As an example,
        the following complementary PWMs(CH2&CH2N) are shown below.
          <&pwm1 2 100 (PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL)>;
          <&pwm1 2 100 (PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL | STM32_PWM_COMPLEMENTARY)>;
