      Number of items to expect in a PWM
      - channel of the timer used for PWM (not used)
      - period to set in ns
      - flags: standard flags like PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL

  pinctrl-0:
    description: |
      PORT pin configuration for the PWM signal.
      We expect that the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes. These
      nodes will have a nodelabel that matches the Infineon SoC Pinctrl
      defines and have following
      format: p<port>_<pin>_<peripheral inst>_<signal>.

      Examples:
        pinctrl-0 = <&p1_1_pwm0_0>;
    required: true

  pinctrl-names:
    required: true

pwm-cells:
  - channel
  - period
  - flags
