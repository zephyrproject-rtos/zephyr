    type: boolean
    description: Set this to use center-aligned (up and down) counter mode.

      IMPORTANT: This option will only be used if the new pin control driver
      is not enabled.

      The channel 0 pin to use.

      For pins P0.0 through P0.31, use the pin number. For example,
      to use P0.16 for channel 0, set:

          ch0-pin = <16>;

      For pins P1.0 through P1.31, add 32 to the pin number. For
      example, to use P1.2 for channel 0, set:

          ch0-pin = <34>;  /* 32 + 2 */

      IMPORTANT: This option will only be used if the new pin control driver
      is not enabled.
      When the pin control driver is enabled, use the "nordic,invert" property
      in the corresponding pin configuration group instead.

      Set this to invert channel 0.

  ch1-pin:
    type: int
    deprecated: true
    description: |
      IMPORTANT: This option will only be used if the new pin control driver
      is not enabled.

      The channel 1 pin to use. The pin numbering scheme is the same
      as the ch0-pin property's.

  ch1-inverted:
    type: boolean
    deprecated: true

      IMPORTANT: This option will only be used if the new pin control driver
      is not enabled.
      When the pin control driver is enabled, use the "nordic,invert" property
      in the corresponding pin configuration group instead.

      Set this to invert channel 1.

  ch2-pin:
    type: int
    deprecated: true

      IMPORTANT: This option will only be used if the new pin control driver
      is not enabled.

      The channel 2 pin to use. The pin numbering scheme is the same
      as the ch0-pin property's.

  ch2-inverted:
    type: boolean
    deprecated: true

      IMPORTANT: This option will only be used if the new pin control driver
      is not enabled.
      When the pin control driver is enabled, use the "nordic,invert" property
      in the corresponding pin configuration group instead.

      Set this to invert channel 2.

      IMPORTANT: This option will only be used if the new pin control driver
      is not enabled.

      The channel 3 pin to use. The pin numbering scheme is the same
      as the ch0-pin property's.

  ch3-inverted:
    type: boolean
    deprecated: true

      When the pin control driver is enabled, use the "nordic,invert" property
      in the corresponding pin configuration group instead.

      Set this to invert channel 3.
