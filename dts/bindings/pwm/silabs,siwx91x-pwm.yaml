  Silabs siwx91x PWM Controller

  The siwx91x PWM controller is designed to generate PWM signals. The mapping
  between PWM channels and GPIO pins is configured through pinctrl settings.

compatible: "silabs,siwx91x-pwm"

include: [base.yaml, pinctrl-device.yaml, pwm-controller.yaml]

properties:
  "#pwm-cells":
    const: 2
