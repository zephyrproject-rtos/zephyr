  PWM channels exposed on Arduino headers.

  Arduino's PWM pin names shares the same definition as Digital pins one.
  That is, the mapping of PWM output on pin D3 on Arduino UNO R3 header is

    pwm-map = <9 0 0 &pwm0 1 0 0>;

compatible: "arduino-header-pwm"

include: [base.yaml, pwm-nexus.yaml]
