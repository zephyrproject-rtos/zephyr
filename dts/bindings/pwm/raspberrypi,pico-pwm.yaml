  divider-int-0:
    type: int
    description: |
      The integral part of the divider for pwm slice 0.
      If a value between 1 and 255 is set, it will be set to the register
      as the integer part of the divider.
      If the value is set to 0 or this property is not defined when setting
      the number of cycles to PWM, a division ratio appropriate to that value is set.

  divider-frac-0:
    type: int
    description: |
      The fractional part of the divider for pwm slice 0.
      This number should be in the range 0 - 15.
      When the "divider-int-0" is set to 0 or is not defined, this property will be
      ignored.
