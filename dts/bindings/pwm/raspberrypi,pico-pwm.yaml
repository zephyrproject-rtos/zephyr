        The integral part of the divider for pwm slice 0.
        This number should be in the range 1 - 255. Defaults
        to 1, the same as the RESET value.

        The fractional part of the divider for pwm slice 0.
        This number should be in the range 0 - 15. Defaults
        to 0, the same as the RESET value.
