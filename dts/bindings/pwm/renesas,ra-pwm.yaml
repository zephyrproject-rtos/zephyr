      A list of interrupt identifiers that correspond to the interrupt lines
      provided in the `interrupts` property. The names must be listed in the
      same order as their matching entries in `interrupts`.
      Common configurations based on the operating mode:
      - Input capture mode:"gtioca", "gtiocb", "overflow"
          "gtioca": Input capture A
          "gtiocb": Input capture B
          "overflow" : Overflow interrupt
