  Espressif's LEDC controller Node

  The LEDC controller is primarily designed to control the intensity of LEDs, although it can be
  used to generate PWM signals for other purposes as well.

  The mapping between the channel and GPIO is done through pinctrl

    &ledc0 {
      pinctrl-0 = <&ledc0_default>;
      pinctrl-names = "default";
    }

  The 'ledc0_default' node state is defined in <board>-pinctrl.dtsi.

    ledc0_default: ledc0_default {
            group1 {
                    pinmux = <LEDC_CH0_GPIO0>,
                             <LEDC_CH1_GPIO2>,
                             <LEDC_CH2_GPIO4>;
                    output-enable;
            };
    };

  If another GPIO mapping is desired, check if <board>-pinctrl.dtsi already have it defined,
  otherwise, define the required mapping at your own application folder into a custom
  <board>.overlay file.
  The 'pinmux' property uses a macro defined in
  https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/hal_espressif/tree/zephyr/include/dt-bindings/pinctrl
  Before including a new node, check if the desired mapping is available according to the SoC.

  As an example, the 'ledc0_custom' state below illustrates an alternate mapping using another set
  of channels and pins in a custom overlay file.

    &pinctrl {

            ledc0_custom:  ledc0_custom {
                    group1 {
                            pinmux = <LEDC_CH0_GPIO0>,
                                     <LEDC_CH9_GPIO2>,
                                     <LEDC_CH10_GPIO4>;
                            output-enable;
                    };
             };

    };

  Use the child bindings to configure the desired channel:

    &ledc0 {
      pinctrl-0 = <&ledc0_custom>;
      pinctrl-names = "default";
      status = "okay";
      #address-cells = <1>;
      #size-cells = <0>;
      channel0@0 {
        reg = <0x0>;
        timer = <0>;
      };
      channel9@9 {
        reg = <0x9>;
        timer = <0>;
        inverted;
      };
      channel10@a {
        reg = <0xa>;
        timer = <1>;
      };
    };

    For the channel to be initially inverted after the driver's init, the flag 'inverted' can
    be declared, as shown above for channel 9.

    Note: The channel's 'reg' property defines the ID of the channel. It must match the channel used
      in the 'pinmux'.

        The ESP32 has 8 low speed channel and 8 high speed channels.
        The low speed channel are mapped from channel 0 to 7, and the high speed are mapped from
        channel 8 to 15.

        High speed channels are only available in the ESP32 SoC. ESP32S2 and ESP32S3 have 8
        available channels, and ESP32C3 has 6. In these SoCs there is no differentiation between
        low or high speed.

        Timer selection.
        For maximum flexibility, the high-speed as well as the low-speed channels can be driven from
        one of four high-speed/low-speed timers.

    inverted:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Initial channel output level.
        This flag defines if the channel will remain initially inverted after driver init,
        as any pwm_set() operation will re-evaluate if the output is inverted or not
        according to the flag passed as parameter.
