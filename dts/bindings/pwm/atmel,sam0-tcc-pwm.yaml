    description: |
      PORT pin configuration for all PWM signals.  We expect that
      the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes.  These nodes will
      have a nodelabel that matches the Atmel SoC HAL defines and
      be of the form p<port><pin><periph>_<inst>_<signal>.

      For example the TCC0 WO3 on SAMR21 could be
         pinctrl-0 = <&pa19f_tcc0_wo3>;
