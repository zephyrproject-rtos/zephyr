  TI MSPM0 PWM node for MSPM0 SoCs. Each channel in MSPM0 can be configured
  to use for PWM operation. There are three PWM modes supported by this module.

  For example to configuring eMIOS instance 0 with:
    - Channel 0 for mode OPWFMB
    - Channel 1 for mode OPWMB

    mspm0pwm: pwm {
      pwm_0 {
        channel = <0>;
        pwm-mode = "EDGE_ALIGN_UP";
        prescaler = <0>;
        period = <65534>;
        duty-cycle = <32768>;
      };

      pwm_1 {
        channel = <1>;
        pwm-mode = "CENTER_ALIGN";
        prescaler = <4>;
        period = <65534>;
        duty-cycle = <32768>;
      };
    };
