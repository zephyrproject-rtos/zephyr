    description: |
      Select one of three possible clock sources for the FTM counter:
        * system: it's the bus interface clock driving the FTM module. Usually
          provides higher timer resolution than the other two clock sources.
        * fixed: it's a fixed clock defined by chip integration.
        * external: it's a clock that can be accessed externally to the chip and
          passes through a sychronizer clocked by the FTM bus interface clock.

      This clock source selection is independent of the bus interface clock
      driving the FTM module. Refer to the chip specific documentation for
      further information.
