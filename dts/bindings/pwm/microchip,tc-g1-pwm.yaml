  Microchip PWM TC g1 driver.

  This driver is responsible for configuring
  and managing the TC peripheral in Microchip microcontrollers for PWM configuration.
  The supported devices :
    - tc-u2249 (3.0.0)

  Example usage in a Device Tree Source (DTS) file:

     pwm_led0: pwm_led_0 {
         status = "okay";
         pwms = <&tc0 1 PWM_MSEC(20) 0>;
     };

  Explanation:
     - 'pwm_led0' is a node representing a device (e.g., an LED) controlled by PWM.
     - The 'pwms' property uses the phandle to the PWM controller (here, 'tc0'),
       specifies channel 2, sets the PWM period to 20 milliseconds,
       and uses a polarity of 0 (normal).
     - The order of the 'pwms' arguments matches the 'pwm-cells' definition:
         <&controller channel period polarity>
     - This allows the device to be driven with a specific PWM configuration using
       the Microchip PWM TC driver.
