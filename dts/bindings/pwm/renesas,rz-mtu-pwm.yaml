  Renesas RZ Multi-Function Timer Pulse Unit (MTU) PWM Controller.

  There are two PWM modes in RZ, PWM mode 1 and PWM mode 2. In this version, we only
  support PWM mode 1.
  The PWM waveform is output from the MTIOCnA and MTIOCnC pins by coupling the TGRA
  register to the TGRB register and the TGRC register to the TGRD register.

      Number of items to expect in a PWM
        - channel of the timer used for PWM
        - period to set in ns
        - flags : combination of standard flags like PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL
