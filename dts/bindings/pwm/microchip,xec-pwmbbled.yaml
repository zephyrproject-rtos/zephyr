      BBLED has two clock inputs.
      - Main system clock (48MHz)
      - 32KHz Core clock (32.768KHz)
      When BBLED enter into Suspend state, 48MHz clock will be switched off by
      PCR(Power, Clock and Reset) block. But 32KHz Core clock will be available to BBLED.
      There may be a product requirement, either to blink (or) not blink LED in Suspend state.
      Flag "enable-low-power-32k" shall be used along with 32KHz clock to blink (or) not blink
      the LED in Suspend state.
