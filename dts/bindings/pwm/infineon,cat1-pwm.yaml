  pinctrl-0:
    description: |
      PORT pin configuration for the PWM signal.
      We expect that the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes. These
      nodes will have a nodelabel that matches the Infineon SoC Pinctrl
      defines and have following
      format: p<port>_<pin>_<peripheral inst>_<signal>.

      Examples:
        pinctrl-0 = <&p1_1_pwm0_0>;

    type: int

  divider-type:
    type: int
    description: |
      Specifies which type of divider to use.
      Defined by cy_en_divider_types_t in cy_sysclk.h.
    required: true

  divider-sel:
    type: int
    description: |
      Specifies which divider of the selected type to configure.
    required: true

  divider-val:
    type: int
    description: |
      Causes integer division of (divider value + 1), or division by 1 to 256
      (8-bit divider) or 1 to 65536 (16-bit divider).
    required: true

  "#pwm-cells":
    const: 3
    description: |
      Number of items to expect in a PWM
      - channel of the timer used for PWM (not used)
      - period to set in ns
      - flags: standard flags like PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL

  - channel
  - period
  - flags
