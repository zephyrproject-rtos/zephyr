  Generic Performance State (P-state) binding

  Implement a generic P-state device node.

  Example configuration:

  performance-states {
          pstate_0: pstate_0 {
                  compatible = "zephyr,generic-pstate";
                  load-threshold = <50>;
                  pstate-id = <0>;
          };
          pstate_1: pstate_1 {
                  compatible = "zephyr,generic-pstate";
                  load-threshold = <20>;
                  pstate-id = <1>;
          };
          pstate_2: pstate_2 {
                  compatible = "zephyr,generic-pstate";
                  load-threshold = <0>;
                  pstate-id = <2>;
          };
  };

compatible: "zephyr,generic-pstate"

include: "zephyr,pstate.yaml"

properties:
  pstate-id:
    type: int
    required: true

      Identifier of performance state. The state IDs shall be unique among all
      sibling nodes. It is recommended that they begin at 0 and monotonically
      increase with decreasing performance (increasing power savings).
