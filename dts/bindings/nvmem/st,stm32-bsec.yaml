title: STMicroelectronics Boot and security control peripheral

description: |
  The boot and security control (BSEC) peripheral manages the accesses to an
  embedded one time programmable (OTP) array of fuses. Those fuses are used to
  store on-chip, non-volatile data like boot and security parameters.
  Embedded non-volatile secrets are stored in BSEC upper area that is only
  accessible while BSEC is operating in its BSEC-closed state. When the BSEC
  state is BSEC-open, those non-volatile secrets are permanently hidden.

  Configuration example at board level:

  bsec: efuse@56009000 {
    compatible = "st,stm32-bsec";
    reg = <0x56009000 0x1000>;

    nvmem-layout {
      compatible = "fixed-layout";
      #address-cells = <1>;
      #size-cells = <1>;

      mac_address0: mac-address@2d8 {
        reg = <0x2d8 0x6>;
        #nvmem-cell-cells = <0>;
      };

      mac_address1: mac-address@2ac {
        reg = <0x2ac 0x6>;
        #nvmem-cell-cells = <0>;
      };
    };
  };

compatible: "st,stm32-bsec"

properties:
  st,upper-fuse-limit:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      This property is used to indicate the limit of the upper fuse region of
      the BSEC. This upper fuse area has particular requirements for the SoC
      state for its access.
