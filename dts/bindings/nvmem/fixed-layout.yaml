    Each child node of the NVMEM provider node represents
    an individual NVMEM cell. These should usually
    look like this:

      cell_nodelabel: cell@START_OFFSET {
              reg = <0xSTART_OFFSET 0xSIZE>;
              #nvmem-cell-cells = <0>;
      };

  properties:
    reg:
      type: array
      required: true
      description: |
        This should be in the format <OFFSET SIZE>, where OFFSET
        is the offset of the NVMEM cell relative to the base
        address of the parent memory, and SIZE is the size of
        the cell in bytes.

    read-only:
      type: boolean
      description: Set this property if the cell is read-only.
