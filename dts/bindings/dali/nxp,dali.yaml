description: DALI interface for nxp lpc11u6x

compatible: "nxp,dali"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  tx-rise-fall-delta-us:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: |
      The time difference of the delays for falling versus the delay for 
      rising edges when transmitting DALI frames. This value needs to be
      set to transmit with correct bit timings.
      The delay is measured in micro seconds.

  rx-rise-fall-delta-us:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: |
      The time difference of the delays for falling versus the delay for 
      rising edges when receiving DALI frames. This value needs to be set
      for correct identification of legal bit timings.
      The delay is measured in micro seconds.

  tx-rx-propagation-min-us:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: |
      The minimal time from a transmitted change to read observation. This 
      value needs to be set for proper collision detection.
      The delay is measured in micro seconds.

  tx-rx-propagation-max-us:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: |
      The maximal time from a transmitted change to read observation. 
      This value needs to be set for proper collision detection.
      The delay is measured in micro seconds.
