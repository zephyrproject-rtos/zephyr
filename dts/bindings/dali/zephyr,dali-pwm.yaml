    tx-rx-delay-us:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        The time in micro seconds the rx signal is still high after the tx signal has gone to low.
        A higher value results in less false positive collision detection. If the value is too high,
        collisions cannot be detected. Should be around 30-100.

    tx-flank-shift-ns:
      type: int
      description: |
        Difference in propagation delay in ns between the falling and rising edge.
        If for example the high to low delay is 8us and low to high is 22us, then enter
        (-14000) here. Keep in low µs range.
      required: false

    rx-flank-shift-ns:
      type: int
      description: |
        Difference in propagation delay in ns between the falling and rising edge.
        If for example the high to low delay is 47us and low to high is 15us, then enter
        (32000) here. Keep in low µs range.
      required: false
