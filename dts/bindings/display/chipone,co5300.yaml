title: CO5300 display controller

description: The Chipone CO5300 is a Circular Display Controller

compatible: "chipone,co5300"

include: [mipi-dsi-device.yaml, display-controller.yaml]

properties:
  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      The RESETn pin is asserted to disable the controller causing a hard
      reset.  The controller receives this as an active-low signal.

  backlight-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      The BLn pin is asserted to control the backlight of the panel.
      The controller receives this as an active-high signal.

  tear-effect-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      The tearing effect pin is asserted by the controller at a display
      VSYNC interval. This permits the controller to send new display
      data during a VSYNC interval, removing tearing.

  pitch-align:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      The CO5300 driver maintains an internal frame buffer. This property
      serves for defining a pitch for it that's compliant with the SoC's
      display controller's requirements.

  addr-align:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      The CO5300 driver maintains an internal frame buffer. This property
      serves for defining an alignment for its address that's compliant
      with the SoC's display controller's requirements.

  ext-ram:
    type: phandle
    description: |
      Secondary RAM in which the panel controller's frame buffer will
      be stored. If not defined, the 'zephyr,ram' chosen memory will be used.
