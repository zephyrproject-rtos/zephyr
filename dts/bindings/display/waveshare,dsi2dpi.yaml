title: Waveshare DSI-to-DPI display bridge

description: |
    Waveshare display shields consist of a DPI panel and a controller board.
    The controller board consists of ICN6211 DSI-to-RGB bridge and an MCU, to
    convert DSI to DPI and control the backlight.
    This binding treats the controller board as a whole unit.
