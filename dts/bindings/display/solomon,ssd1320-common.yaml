properties:
  oscillator-freq:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Front clock divider (3:0) / oscillator frequency (7:4). It can be set to 0x0.
      If you get weird scanlines, increase oscillator frequency and play with phase length values,
      for example set this to 0x70. Note this increases power consumption.

  display-offset:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Vertical offset by com from 0 ~ 159. Typically 160 - height.

  start-line:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Start line of display RAM to be displayed by selecting a value from 0 to 159.
      Typically 0.

  multiplex-ratio:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Multiplex ratio from 15MUX to 159MUX. Typically same value as height - 1.

  remap-value:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Remap register

      Has multiple configurations (see each bit setting in the datasheet)
      - A[1] must be 1
      - Sequential (0) or Alternative (Odd/Even) SEGs (A[4])
      - Disable or Enable SEG left/right remap (A[5])

      A[4] is needed when display has striping.

  phase-length:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Phase Length for segment charging (7:4) and discharging (3:0).
      Good values to try first are 0x1f and 0xf1.

  internal-iref:
    type: int
    default: 0x10
    description: Internal or external iref. 0x0 is External, 0x10 Internal.
      Most displays use Internal.

  precharge-voltage:
    type: int
    default: 0x1E
    description: Set precharge voltage (4:0) from 0.10 x VCC to 0.5113 x VCC (0x1F).
      0x1E is the reset default.

  vcomh-voltage:
    type: int
    default: 0x20
    description: Set COM deselect voltage (5:3) from 0.72 x VCC (0x0) to 0.84 x VCC (0x30)
      0x20 is the reset default.

  inversion-on:
    type: boolean
    description: Turn on display color inverting

  greyscale-enhancement:
    type: boolean
    description: Enable low greyscale enhancement, partially undocumented.

  inv-seg:
    type: boolean
    description: Invert segment order

  inv-com:
    type: boolean
    description: Invert COM order
