  segments-per-pixel:
    type: int
    default: 1
    enum:
      - 1
      - 2
    description: |
      Map multiple adjacent segments to one pixel.
      Some displays (such as the Newhaven Display NHD-2.7-12864WDW3) connect
      two adjacent pixel drivers to each physical pixel. By setting this to 2,
      the driver will repeat each pixel. The default disables this functionality,
      as it only applies to very specific display models.
