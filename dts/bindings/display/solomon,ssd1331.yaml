description: SSD1331 display controller

compatible: "solomon,ssd1331"

include: [mipi-dbi-spi-device.yaml, display-controller.yaml]

properties:
  display-offset:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Vertical offset by com from 0 ~ 63. Typically 64 - height.

  start-line:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Start line of display RAM to be displayed by selecting a value from 0 to 63.
      Typically 0.

  multiplex-ratio:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Multiplex ratio from 16MUX to 64MUX, ranges from 15 to 63.
      Typically same value as height - 1.

  phase-length:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Phase 2 Period (7:4) and Phase 1 Period (3:0).

  oscillator-freq:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Front clock divider (3:0) / oscillator frequency (7:4).
      If you get weird scanlines, increase oscillator frequency and play with phase length values,
      for example set this to 0xF0. Note this increases power consumption.

  precharge-time-a:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Set precharge time for segments A. Typically around 0x70.

  precharge-time-b:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Set precharge time for segments B. Typically around 0x70.

  precharge-time-c:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Set precharge time for segments C. Typically around 0x70.

  precharge-voltage:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Set precharge voltage. A[5:1], from 0 (0.10 x VCC) to 0x3E (0.5 x VCC)

  vcomh-voltage:
    type: int
    required: true
    enum:
      - 0x0
      - 0x10
      - 0x20
      - 0x30
      - 0x3E
    description: Set COM deselect voltage. A[5:1]. 0.44, 0.52, 0.61, 0.71, 0.83 x VCC.

  current-att:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Set Master current attenuation. A[3:0], from 1/16 to 16/16.

  remap-value:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Remap register

      Has multiple configurations (see each bit setting in the datasheet)
      - A[0] HTiled or VTiled. Must be 0 for this driver.
      - A[1] Invert segment order
      - A[2] Invert ABC segment order
      - A[3] Left-Right Swap COMs
      - A[4] Invert COM order
      - A[5] Stripped odd/even display
      - A[7:6] Set color format. Must be 0x1 for this driver.

  power-save:
    type: boolean
    description: Enable Power Save mode

  inversion-on:
    type: boolean
    description: Turn on display color inverting
