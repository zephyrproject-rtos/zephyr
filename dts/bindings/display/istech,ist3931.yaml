title: IST3931 65x132 display controller

description: |
    The Istech IST3931 is a monochrome STN LCD controller
    with a maximum 132x65 resolution.

compatible: "istech,ist3931"

include: [i2c-device.yaml, display-controller.yaml]

properties:
  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
