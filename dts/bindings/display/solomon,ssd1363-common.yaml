properties:
  oscillator-freq:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Front clock divider (3:0) / oscillator frequency (7:4). It can be set to 0x0.
      If you get weird scanlines, increase oscillator frequency and play with phase length values,
      for example set this to 0x70. Note this increases power consumption.

  display-offset:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Vertical offset by com from 0 ~ 159. Typically 160 - height.

  start-line:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Start line of display RAM to be displayed by selecting a value from 0 to 159.
      Typically 0.

  multiplex-ratio:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Multiplex ratio from 3MUX to 159MUX. Typically same value as height - 1.

  remap-value:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Remap register of 16-bits length

      Has multiple configurations (see each bit setting in the datasheet)
      first byte [15:8]
      - A[0] 0 is htiled, 1 is vtiled
      - A[1] invert SEG mapping
      - A[3] reserved
      - A[4] Invert COM
      - A[5] Sequential (0) or Alternative (Odd/Even) COMs
      second byte [7:0]
      - B[0] reserved
      - B[4] Dual COM mode (mux <= 79)

      A[5] is needed when display has striping.

  phase-length:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Phase Length for segment charging (7:4) and discharging (3:0).
      Good values to try first are 0x1f and 0xf1.

  column-offset:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Offset in columns. Typically (320 - width) / 2.
      This is done in software as SSD1363 lacks hardware tooling for this.

  precharge-period:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Second pre-charge period ranging from 0 to 15 DCLK's.

  internal-iref:
    type: int
    default: 0x90
    description: Internal or external iref. 0x80 is External, 0x90 Internal.
      Most displays use Internal.

  precharge-config:
    type: int
    default: 0x3
    description: Vp pin floating (0x2) or linked to external capacitance (0x3).
      Most displays use a external capacitor.

  precharge-voltage:
    type: int
    default: 0x7
    description: Set precharge voltage (4:0) from 0.10 x VCC to 0.513 x VCC (0x1F).
      0x7 is the reset default.

  vcomh-voltage:
    type: int
    default: 0x4
    description: Set COM deselect voltage (3:0) from 0.72 x VCC (0x0) to 0.86 x VCC (0x7)
      0x4 is the reset default.

  inversion-on:
    type: boolean
    description: Turn on display color inverting

  greyscale-enhancement:
    type: boolean
    description: Enable greyscale enhancement, undocumented.

  greyscale-table:
    type: uint8-array
    description: 15 elements array defines gamma settings for each brightness levels.
      It seems last element must always be 60/0x3C.
