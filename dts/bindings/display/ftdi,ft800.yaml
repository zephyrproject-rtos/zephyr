properties:
  irq-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: Optional IRQ line of FT800 controller

  pclk:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      The value to divide the main clock by for PCLK. If the
      typical main clock was 48MHz and this value is 5, the PCLK
      will be 9.6 MHz. Must be positive value to enable the screen

  pclk-pol:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Polarity of PCLK. If it is set to zero, PCLK polarity is on
      the rising edge. If it is set to one, PCLK polarity is on
      the falling edge.

  cspread:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Controls the transition of RGB signals with PCLK active clock
      edge. When set to 0, R[7:2],G[7:2] and B[7:2] signals change
      following the active edge of PCLK. When set to 1, R[7:2]
      changes a PCLK clock early and B[7:2] a PCLK clock later,
      which helps reduce the system noise.

  swizzle:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Controls the arrangement of output RGB pins, which may help
      support different LCD panel. Please check FT800 Programmers
      Guide for details.

  vsize:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Number of visible lines of pixels in one frame

  voffset:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Number of invisible lines at the beginning of a new frame

  vcycle:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Number of all lines in a frame. It includes all visible and
      invisible lines at the beginning and at the end of a frame.

  vsync0:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Number of lines for the high state of signal VSYNC at
      the start of new frame.

  vsync1:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Number of lines for signal VSYNC toggle takes at the start
      of new frame.

  hsize:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Number of PCLK cycles per visible part of horizontal line

  hoffset:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Number of PCLK cycles before pixels are scanned out for
      given line

  hcycle:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Number of total PCLK cycles per horizontal line scan.

  hsync0:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Number of PCLK cycles of HSYNC high state during start of
      line

  hsync1:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Number of PCLK cycles for HSYNC toggle during start of line.
