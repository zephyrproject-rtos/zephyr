  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: RESET pin.

      The RESET pin of SSD16XX is active low.
      If connected directly the MCU pin should be configured
      as active low.

  dc-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: DC pin.

      The DC pin of SSD16XX is active low (transmission command byte).
      If connected directly the MCU pin should be configured
      as active low.

  busy-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: BUSY pin.

      The BUSY pin of SSD16XX is active high.
      If connected directly the MCU pin should be configured
      as active high.
