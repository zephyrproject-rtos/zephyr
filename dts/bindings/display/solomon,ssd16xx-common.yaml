description: SSD16XX EPD display controller

include: [mipi-dbi-spi-device.yaml, display-controller.yaml]

properties:
  softstart:
    type: uint8-array
    description: Booster soft start values

  busy-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: BUSY pin.

      The BUSY pin of SSD16XX is active high.
      If connected directly the MCU pin should be configured
      as active high.

  tssv:
    type: int
    description: Temperature Sensor Selection Value

      Display controller can have integrated temperature sensor or
      an external temperature sensor is connected to the controller.
      The value selects which sensor should be used.

  rotation:
    type: int
    default: 0
    enum:
      - 0
      - 90
      - 180
      - 270
    description:
      Display rotation (CW) in degrees.
      If not defined, rotation is off by default.

  scan-y-reverse:
    type: boolean
    description: Reverse the scan direction along Y axis for the display.

      Some displays have the scan direction reversed along the Y axis.

  gdo-flags:
    type: int
    description: Gate scanning sequence and direction

      Additional flags passed into Driver Output control command to
      determine the how the output pin layout for the panel is and
      what should be scanning sequence and the direction.

child-binding:
  description: |
    Child nodes describe refresh profiles. Each refresh profile
    specifies a set of voltages used to drive the refresh
    cycle. Refresh profiles are optional and are used to override
    defaults loaded from the controllers OTP memory.

    Partial refresh will be disabled unless a partial refresh profile
    has been specified. That profile may be empty to use the defaults
    loaded from OTP if supported by the device.

    The driver typically looks for the following child nodes:

      - 'full' - Normal / full refresh.
      - 'partial' - Partial refresh.
