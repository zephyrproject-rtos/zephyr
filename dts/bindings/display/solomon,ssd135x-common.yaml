description: SSD135x type display controller

include: [mipi-dbi-spi-device.yaml, display-controller.yaml]

properties:
  display-offset:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Vertical offset by com from 0 ~ 127. Typically 128 - height.

  start-line:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Start line of display RAM to be displayed by selecting a value from 0 to 127.
      Typically 0.

  multiplex-ratio:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Multiplex ratio from 16MUX to 128MUX, ranges from 15 to 127.
      Typically same value as height - 1.

  phase-length:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Phase 2 Period (7:4) and Phase 1 Period (3:0).

  oscillator-freq:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Front clock divider (3:0) / oscillator frequency (7:4).
      If you get weird scanlines, increase oscillator frequency and play with phase length values,
      for example set this to 0xF1. Note this increases power consumption.

  precharge-time:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Set 2nd precharge time for segments from 0 DCLK to 15 DCLK, 0 is invalid. A[3:0].
      Typically 0x8.

  precharge-voltage:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Set precharge voltage. A[4:0], from 0 (0.20 x VCC) to 0x1F (0.6 x VCC)

  vcomh-voltage:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Set COM deselect voltage. A[2:0]. From 0.72xVCC to 0.86xVCC.

  current-att:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Set Master current attenuation. A[3:0], from 1/16 to 16/16.

  remap-value:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Remap register

      Has multiple configurations (see each bit setting in the datasheet)
      - A[0] HTiled or VTiled. Must be 0 for this driver.
      - A[1] Invert segment order
      - A[2] Invert ABC segment order
      - A[4] Invert COM order
      - A[5] Stripped odd/even display
      - A[7:6] Set color format. Must be 0x1 for this driver. 0x0 Also works for SSD1351.

  inversion-on:
    type: boolean
    description: Turn on display color inverting

  column-offset:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: Some vertical displays may need a column address offset to work properly.
