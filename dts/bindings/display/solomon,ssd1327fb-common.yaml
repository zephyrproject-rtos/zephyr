properties:
  oscillator-freq:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Front clock divider (3:0) / oscillator frequency (7:4). It can be set to 0x0.
      If you get weird scanlines, increase oscillator frequency and play with phase length values,
      for example set this to 0x70. Note this increases power consumption.

  display-offset:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Vertical offset by com from 0 ~ 127. Typically 128 - height.

  start-line:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Start line of display RAM to be displayed by selecting a value from 0 to 127.
      Typically 0.

  multiplex-ratio:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Multiplex ratio from 15MUX to 127MUX. Typically same value as height - 1.

  prechargep:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Pre-charge period ranging from 0 to 15 DCLK's

  remap-value:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Remap register

      Has multiple configurations (see each bit setting in the datasheet)
      - Column Address Remapping (A[0])
      - Nibble Remapping (A[1])
      - Address increment mode (A[2]), off is horizontal, on is vertical.
      - COM Remapping (A[4])
      - Undocumented related to a monochrome mode, not supported by all displays (A[5])
      - Splitting of Odd / Even COM Signals (A[6])

      A[0], A[1], and A[4], define flipping of the display.
      A[6] is needed when display has striping.
      A[2] and A[5] must be off for this driver.

  phase-length:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Phase Length for segment charging (7:4) and discharging (3:0).
      Good values to try first are 0x1f and 0xf1.

  function-selection-b:
    type: int
    default: 0x62
    description: Enables second precharge (A[1]), and external Voltage Segment Level (A[0])
      The value can either be 0x61, 0x62, or 0x63. Most displays use 0x62.

  precharge-voltage:
    type: int
    default: 0x8
    description: Set precharge voltage (0:4) from 0.20 x VCC to 0.613 x VCC (0x7) and VCOMH (0x8+).
      Most displays support 0x8.

  vcomh-voltage:
    type: int
    default: 0x7
    description: Set precharge voltage (0:3) from 0.72 x VCC to 0.86 x VCC
      Most displays support 0x7.

  inversion-on:
    type: boolean
    description: Turn on display color inverting

  grayscale-table:
    type: uint8-array
    description: 15 elements array defines gamma settings for each brightness levels.
