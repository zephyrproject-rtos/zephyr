properties:
  oscillator-freq:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Front clock divider (3:0) / oscillator frequency (7:4). It can be set to 0x0.
      If you get weird scanlines, increase oscillator frequency and play with phase length values,
      for example set this to 0x90. Note this increases power consumption.

  display-offset:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Vertical offset by com from 0 ~ 63. Typically 64 - height.

  start-line:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Start line of display RAM to be displayed by selecting a value from 0 to 63.
      Typically 0.

  multiplex-ratio:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Multiplex ratio from 0MUX to 63MUX. Typically same value as height - 1.

  phase-length:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Phase Length for segment charging (7:4) and discharging (3:0).

  vcomh-voltage:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Set COM deselect voltage

  precharge-voltage:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Set precharge voltage VSEGM. refer to datasheet for formula

  dc-dc:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Internal DC-DC enable and set frequency.

  low-voltage:
    type: int
    default: 0x0
    description: set discharge VSL level. 0x0 (0V) is the reset value

  inversion-on:
    type: boolean
    description: Turn on display color inverting

  inv-seg:
    type: boolean
    description: Invert segment order

  inv-com:
    type: boolean
    description: Invert COM order
