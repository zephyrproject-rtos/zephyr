description: STM32 family VREF+ node

compatible: "st,stm32-vref"

include: sensor-device.yaml

properties:
  vrefint-cal-addr:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Device engineering bytes address containing the factory-measured
      calibration bandgap voltage (VREFINT_CAL).

  vrefint-cal-mv:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      VDDA/VREF+ voltage in millivolts applied during manufacturing to determine
      the internal bandgap voltage reference VREFINT.

  vrefint-cal-resolution:
    type: int
    description: |
      ADC resolution used for measuring calibration data

      This is usually equal to the ADC's native resolution.

      Most series have a 12-bit ADC, but 14-bit and 16-bit
      also exists on e.g., STM32U5 and STM32H7 series.
    default: 12
    enum:
      - 12
      - 14
      - 16
