description: PAT9136 optical flow sensor

compatible: "pixart,pat9136"

include: [sensor-device.yaml, spi-device.yaml]

properties:
  resolution:
    type: int
    default: 19
    description: |
      The resolution of the sensor which indirectly results in counts per inch
      (CPI), following the formula CPI = (1 + resolution) * 100.
      Valid range is 0 to 199.
      Default is value set during Performance Optimization Settings.

  int-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      The INT signal default configuration is active-low. The
      property value should ensure the flags properly describe the
      signal that is presented to the driver.

  backup-timer-ms:
    type: int
    default: 50
    description: |
      The back-up timer in milliseconds used to ensure sensor interaction
      even if no motion is present, when Data-Ready streaming trigger is
      configured.
      Default is 1000X the fastest frame rate (20,000 fps).

  cooldown-timer-ms:
    type: int
    default: 10
    description: |
      The cooldown timer in milliseconds used to prevent flooding the system
      with interrupts (potentially at max 20,000 fps) while Data-Ready
      streaming trigger is configured.
      Default is 200X the fastest frame rate (20,000 fps).
      Must be less than backup-timer-ms.
