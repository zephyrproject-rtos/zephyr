description: NPM2100 PMIC Battery Voltage

compatible: "nordic,npm2100-vbat"

include: [sensor-device.yaml]

properties:
  vout-min-microvolt:
    type: int
    description: |
      Minimum Vout level.
      When Vout falls to this level, the PMIC will allow more current to flow
      from the battery by dropping to the vbatminl battery threshold.

  vbat-min-microvolt:
    type: int
    description: |
      Initial value for vbatminl and vbatminh.
      The boost converter will not allow the battery to drop below this level.
