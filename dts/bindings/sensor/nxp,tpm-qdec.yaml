  NXP Timer/PWM Module (TPM) Quadrature Decoder Mode driver.
  This driver uses tpm_chn0 (phase A) and tpm_chn1 (phase B) input signals to control the
  TPM counter increment and decrement. The Zephyr Sensor API exposes the rotational position as
  SENSOR_CHAN_ROTATION by dividing the counter by counts-per revolution definition.

  To use the NXP TPM module you've to override the compatible string to use the QDEC mode driver
  with 'nxp,tpm-qdec'

  &tpm4 {
        compatible = "nxp,tpm-qdec";
        status = "okay";
        pinctrl-0 = <&tpm4_pwm2_pwm3>;
        pinctrl-names = "default";
        micro-ticks-per-rev = <685440000>;
   };

  When inherting from an existing TPM instance you might want to remove the prescaler property
  Since the QDEC mode doesn't use the prescaler, you do this using:
  /delete-property/ prescaler;

compatible: "nxp,tpm-qdec"

      This is a number that is used to determine how many revolutions * 1000000
      were done based on the current counter's value.
