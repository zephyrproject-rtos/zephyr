description: MPU-6000 motion tracking device

# MPU-6000 is SPI or I2C.  MPU-6050 is I2C-only.  Driver does not
# support SPI so stick with I2C variant.

properties:
  int-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      The INT signal default configuration is active-high.  The
      property value should ensure the flags properly describe the
      signal that is presented to the driver.

  accel-fs:
    type: int
    default: 2
    description: |
      Accelerometer full-scale range.
      An X value represents a range of +/- X g.
      The power-on reset state of the sensor matches the default value of 2.
    enum:
      - 2
      - 4
      - 8
      - 16

  gyro-fs:
    type: int
    default: 250
    description: |
      Gyroscope full-scale range.
      An X value represents a range of +/- X deg/s.
      The power-on reset state of the sensor matches the default value of 250.
    enum:
      - 250
      - 500
      - 1000
      - 2000

  smplrt-div:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      The base sample rate is 8 kHz for the gyroscope and 1 kHz for
      the accelerometer.
      A division factor of X sets the sample rate to: baserate / (1 + X).
      Valid values for X are 0 through 255.
      The power-on reset state of the sensor matches the default value of 0.
