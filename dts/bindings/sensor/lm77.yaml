  LM77 digital temperature sensor

compatible: "lm77"

include: [sensor-device.yaml, i2c-device.yaml]

properties:
  int-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Identifies the INT signal, which is active-low open drain by default
      when produced by the sensor.

  int-inverted:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      When present, the polarity on the INT signal is inverted (active-high).

  tcrita-inverted:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      When present, the polarity on the T_CRIT_A signal is inverted
      (active-high).

  enable-fault-queue:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      When present, the fault queue is enabled. The fault queue allows up to 4
      faults to prevent false INT/T_CRIT_A tripping when the LM77 is used in
      noisy environments.
