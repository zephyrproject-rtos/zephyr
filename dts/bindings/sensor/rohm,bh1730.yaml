properties:
  gain:

    default: 0
    description: |
      ADC resolution setting
      0 = x1 gain mode
      1 = x2 gain mode
      2 = x64 gain mode
      3 = x128 gain mode
      Lower gain values (x1 and x2) reduce sensitivity and prevent
      saturation in brighter environments.
      Higher gain values (x64 and x128) result in higher sensitivity,
      which are useful in low-light environments.
      The default corresponds to the reset value of the GAIN register.
    enum:
      - 0
      - 1
      - 2
      - 3
  itime:
    type: int
    default: 0xDA
    description: |
      ITIME value in TIMING register determines integration time.
      Higher values result in longer integration time and
      increased accuracy.
      The default corresponds to the reset value of the TIMING register.
