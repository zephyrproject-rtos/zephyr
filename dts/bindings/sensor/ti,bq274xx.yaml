        The INT signal defaults to active low open drain, so requires a
        pull-up on the board. By default it acts as an output and signals
        specific events happening (e.g. change in State of Charge). While in
        shutdown mode it acts as an input and toggling it will make the sensor
        exit the mode.

    zephyr,lazy-load:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Configuring the sensor can take a long time, using lazy loading we can delay
        until the first sample request and keep the boot time as short as possible.
