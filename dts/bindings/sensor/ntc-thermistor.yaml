description: Generic NTC Thermistor

include: [sensor-device.yaml]

properties:
  io-channels:
    required: true
    description: |
      ADC IO channel connected to this NTC thermistor.

  r25-ohm:
    type: int
    description: |
      The resistance value of the thermistor at 25 C.

  pullup-uv:
    type: int
    description: |
      The pullup voltage microvoltage in the circuit.

  pullup-ohm:
    type: int
    description: |
      The pullup resistance in the circuit.

  pulldown-ohm:
    type: int
    description: |
      The pulldown resistance in the circuit.

  connected-positive:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Indicates how the thermistor is connected in series with a pull-up and/or
      a pull-down resistor. If this flag is NOT specified, the thermistor is
      assumed to be connected-ground, which usually means a pull-down resistance
      of zero but complex arrangements are possible.
