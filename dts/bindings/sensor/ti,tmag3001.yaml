  TMAG3001 Low-Power 3D Linear and Angle Hall-Effect Sensor With I2C Interface
  and Wake Up Detection in WCSP.

  See the specification for the default I2C address.

  The specification of the sensor can be found at:
    https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tmag3001.pdf

  Currently, this driver shares implementation with tmag5273. When setting the
  enum properties in a .dts or .dtsi file you may include
  `zephyr/dt-bindings/sensor/tmag5273.h` and use the macros defined there.

compatible: "ti,tmag3001"

include: ["ti,tmag5273.yaml"]
