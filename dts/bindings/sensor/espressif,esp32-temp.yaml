      The temperature sensor is available on the ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3, ESP32-C3.
      Note that it is unavailable on the ESP32 due to missing offset calibration.
      Temperature range is defined by the temperature offset which is used during
      calculation of the output temperature from the measured value.

    enum:
    - 0    # measure range: 50°C ~ 125°C, error < 3°C
