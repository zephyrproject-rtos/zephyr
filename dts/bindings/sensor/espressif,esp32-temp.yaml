  ESP32 internal temperature sensor

  This peripheral supports a number of measurement ranges with different
  precisions, based on the temperature range expected for the device to operate:

      Range (°C)      Error
      50 to 125       < 3°C
      20 to 100       < 2°C
      -10 to 80       < 1°C
      -30 to 50       < 2°C
      -40 to 20       < 3°C

  The range and corresponding expected precision are selected through the
  user-defined `range-min` and `range-max` properties. The default values
  represent a typical operating temperature range while selecting the best
  precision.
