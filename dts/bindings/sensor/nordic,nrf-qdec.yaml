        The A pin to use.

        For pins P0.0 through P0.31, use the pin number. For example,
        to use P0.16 for the A pin, set:

            a-pin = <16>;

        For pins P1.0 through P1.31, add 32 to the pin number. For
        example, to use P1.2 for the A pin, set:

            a-pin = <34>;  /* 32 + 2 */

        The B pin to use. The pin numbering scheme is the same as
        the a-pin property's.

        The LED pin to use for a light based QDEC device. The pin
        numbering scheme is the same as the a-pin property's.

        The enable pin to use, to enable a connected QDEC device. The
