      The enable pin to use, to enable a connected QDEC device

      For pins P0.0 through P0.31, use the pin number. For example,
      to use P0.16 for the A pin, set:

          enable-pin = <16>;

      For pins P1.0 through P1.31, add 32 to the pin number. For
      example, to use P1.2 for the A pin, set:

          enable-pin = <34>;  /* 32 + 2 */
