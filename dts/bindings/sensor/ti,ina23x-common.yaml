      Value of the configuration register
      e.g shunt voltage and bus voltage ADC conversion
      times and averaging, operating mode for INA230 or
      delay for initial ADC conversion, shunt full scale range
      for INA237.

  current-lsb-microamps:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      This value should be selected so that measurement resolution is
      maximized, that is:

        current-lsb(A) = maximum expected current(A) / 2^15

      (sensor has 15 bits). For example, if maximum expected current is 15A:

        current-lsb(A) = 15A / 2^15 ~= 457uA

      Rounded values may be used for convenience, e.g. 500uA/LSB or 1mA/LSB
      while keeping a good measurement resolution. The units are in uA/LSB
      so that low maximum currents can be measured with enough resolution.
