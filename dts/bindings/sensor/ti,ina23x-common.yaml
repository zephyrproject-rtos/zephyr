        Value of the configuration register
        e.g shunt voltage and bus voltage ADC conversion
        times and averaging, operating mode for INA230 or
        delay for initial ADC conversion, shunt full scale range
        for INA237.

    current-lsb:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        Value of Current LSB in milliamps. When set to 1mA,
        Current is read in A, Bus Voltage in V, Shunt
        Voltage in V, and Power in mW. Any other value
        results in Current, Voltage, and Power registers
        being read in counts.

      type: int
      required: true
      description: Shunt resistor value in milliohms
