  alert-gpios:
    type: phandle-array

      ALERT pin
      This pin defaults to active low when produced by the sensor.
      The property value should ensure the gpio flags properly describe
      the signal that is presented to the driver. Required in order to use
      triggering support.

  resolution:
    type: string
    default: "9-bit"
    enum:
      - "9-bit"
      - "10-bit"
      - "11-bit"
      - "12-bit"

      Sensor resolution. Higher resolutions will result in longer conversion
      times. Note: datasheet's claim about the ambient temperature register:
      > When the 0.5°C, 0.25°C or 0.125°C resolutions are selected,
      > bit 6, bit 7 or bit 8 will remain clear <0>,
      > respectively.
      appears to be incorrect. Only conversion times seem to be affected by
      resolution selection.

  oneshot-mode:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Oneshot sampling mode. Reduces power consumption, but disables triggering
      feature as well as high resolution sampling. Only supported with 9 bit
      resolution.
