  Sensirion SHTCx humidity and temperature sensor

  Additionally use "sensirion,shtc1" or "sensirion,shtc3" compatibles
  such that a generic driver can consider chip specific behaviour.

  Example device tree node describing a Sensirion SHTC3 Sensor on the i2c0 bus:

   &i2c0 {
      status = "okay";
      clock-frequency = <I2C_BITRATE_FAST>;
      shtc3@70 {
        compatible = "sensirion,shtc3", "sensirion,shtcx";
        reg = <0x70>;
        measure-mode = "normal";
        clock-stretching;
     };
   };

compatible: "sensirion,shtcx"

include: [sensor-device.yaml, i2c-device.yaml]

properties:
  measure-mode:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: |
      Specifies which measurement mode is used.
      SHTC1 sensor only supports the normal measuremnt mode.
    enum:
      - "normal"
      - "low-power"

  clock-stretching:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Specifies that the driver should clock stretching i2c communication to
      read the sensor values.
