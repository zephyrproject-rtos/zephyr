  VCNL36825T proximity and ambient light sensor.  See datasheet at
  https://www.vishay.com/docs/84274/vcnl36825t.pdf

compatible: "vishay,vcnl36825t"

include: [sensor-device.yaml, i2c-device.yaml]

properties:
  operation-mode:
    type: string
    default: "auto"
    enum: ["auto", "force"]
    description: |
      Mode of operation.
      - "auto": the sensor performs sampling continuously,
      - "force": the sampling is performed on every fetch command.

      Defaults to sensor reset value.

  measurement-period:
    type: int
    default: 40
    enum: [10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320]
    description: |
      Measurement period of the sensors in ms.
      Higher values yield lower power consumption.
      Note:
        - [10, 80] ms only if low power mode is inactive
        - [80, 320] ms only in low power mode

      Defaults to 40 ms which is supported in both normal and low-power mode.

  proximity-it:
    type: string
    default: "1"
    enum: ["1", "1.5", "2", "2.5", "3", "3.5", "4", "8"]
    description: |
      Proximity integration time in T.
      Defaults to sensor reset value.

  proximity-itb:
    type: int
    default: 25
    enum: [25, 50]
    description: |
      Duration of the proximity integration time T in us.
      Defaults to sensor reset value.

  multi-pulse:
    type: int
    default: 1
    enum: [1, 2, 4, 8]
    description: |
      Number of pulses per single measurement.
      Higher values increase accuracy and power consumption.
      Defaults to sensor reset value.

  laser-current:
    type: int
    default: 10
    enum: [10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
    description: |
      Current used by the laser during measurement periods.
      Defaults to minimum allowed value.

  low-power:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Activate low power mode.
      This allows to increase the measurement period up to 320 ms.

  high-gain:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Activate the high gain mode.

  sunlight-cancellation:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Activate sunlight cancellation.

  high-dynamic-output:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Activate 16bit high dynamic output mode.
      Cannot be used with threshold interrupt.
