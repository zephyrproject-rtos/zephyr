properties:
    ts-cal1-addr:
      type: int

    ts-cal1-temp:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        temperature at which temperature sensor has been
        calibrated in production for data into ts-cal1-addr

    ts-cal2-temp:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        temperature at which temperature sensor has been
        calibrated in production for data into ts-cal2-addr

    ts-cal-vrefanalog:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        Analog voltage reference (Vref+) voltage with which
        temperature sensor has been calibrated in production

    ts-cal-resolution:

      required: false
      description: |
        Temperature calibration resolution with which the ts-cal1-temp and
        ts-cal2-temp are measured.
        For most stm32 series a native 12-bit ADC is embedded in the device,
        except for H7 on 16-bit and U5 on 14-bit
      default: 12
