description: Common fields for STM32 family TEMP production calibrated sensors

include: [base.yaml, "st,stm32-temp-common.yaml"]

properties:
  ts-cal1-addr:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: address of parameter TS_CAL1

  ts-cal1-temp:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      temperature at which temperature sensor has been
      calibrated in production for data into ts-cal1-addr

  ts-cal-vrefanalog:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Analog voltage reference (Vref+) voltage with which
      temperature sensor has been calibrated in production

  ts-cal-resolution:
    type: int
    description: |
      Temperature calibration resolution with which the ts-cal1-temp and
      ts-cal2-temp are measured.
      For most stm32 series a native 12-bit ADC is embedded in the device,
      except for H7 on 16-bit and U5 on 14-bit
    default: 12
    enum:
    - 12
    - 14
    - 16
