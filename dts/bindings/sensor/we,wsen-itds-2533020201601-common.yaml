    description: Output data rate in Hz
      Note that the available output data rates depend on the selected operating mode. In
      high performance mode the output data rate of the sensor can be configured between
      12.5 Hz and 1600 Hz. In normal/low power mode the output data rate of the sensor can
      be configured between 1.6 Hz and 200 Hz. Consult the ITDS user manual for more
      information.
      Also note that the minimum ODR required for using the tap recognition functionality
      is 400 Hz.

      - 4 #  4g (0.488 mg/LSB)
      - 2 #  2g (0.244 mg/LSB)
    description: Range (full scale) in g. Defaults to 2, which is
      the configuration at power-up.

  low-noise:
    type: boolean
    description: Enables low-noise mode.

  tap-mode:
    type: int
    default: 0
    enum:
      - 0 # Only single tap
      - 1 # Single and double tap
    description: Tap mode (only single tap or single and double tap).
      Defaults to 0, which is the configuration at power-up.

  tap-threshold:
    type: array
    default: [0, 0, 0]
    description: |
      Tap X/Y/Z axis thresholds (unsigned 5-bit, ranging from 0x00 to 0x1F).
      Defaults to "<0>, <0>, <0>", which is the configuration at power-up.

      Thresholds for tap recognition on the X/Y/Z axes corresponding to a
      2g full-scale range. Setting a threshold to zero disables tap
      detection on the corresponding axis.

      Example:

          tap-threshold = <0>, <6>, <10>

      This disables tap recognition on X axis and sets thresholds for Y and Z
      as follows: Y = 6 \* 2g/32 = 375mg and Z = 10 \* 2g/32 = 625mg.

  tap-shock:
    type: int
    default: 0x0
    description: |
      Maximum duration of over-threshold event when detecting taps (unsigned
      2-bit, ranging from 0x0 to 0x3). Defaults to zero, which is the
      configuration at power-up.

      A value of 0 corresponds to 4 \* 1/ODR and 1 LSB = 8 \* 1/ODR.

  tap-latency:
    type: int
    default: 0x0
    description: |
      Maximum duration time gap for double-tap recognition (unsigned 4-bit,
      ranging from 0x0 to 0xF). Defaults to zero, which is the
      configuration at power-up.

      A value of 0 corresponds to 16 \* 1/ODR and 1 LSB = 32 \* 1/ODR.

  tap-quiet:
    type: int
    default: 0x0
    description: |
      Expected quiet time for double-tap recognition (unsigned 2-bit, ranging
      from 0x0 to 0x3). This defines the time after the first detected tap in
      which there must not be any over-threshold event. Defaults to zero, which
      is the configuration at power-up.

      A value of 0 corresponds to 2 \* 1/ODR and 1 LSB = 4 \* 1/ODR.

  freefall-duration:
    type: int
    default: 0x0
    description: |
      Minimum duration of free-fall event (unsigned 6-bit, ranging from 0x0
      to 0x3F). Defaults to 0, which is the configuration at power-up.

      1 LSB = 1 \* 1/ODR.

  freefall-threshold:
    type: int
    default: 0x5
    enum:
      - 5  # 156.50 mg
      - 7  # 218.75 mg
      - 8  # 250.00 mg
      - 10  # 312.50 mg
      - 11  # 343.75 mg
      - 13  # 406.25 mg
      - 15  # 468.75 mg
      - 16  # 500.00 mg
    description: |
      Free-fall threshold (amplitude of the "free-fall zone" around zero-g
      level where the accelerations of all axes are small enough to generate
      the free-fall interrupt). Defaults to 0x5, which is the configuration
      at power-up.

      Multiply by 31.25mg to get the used threshold.

  delta-duration:
    type: int
    default: 0x0
    enum:
      - 0
      - 1
      - 2
      - 3
    description: |
      Wake-up duration, i.e. minimum duration of wake-up event to be
      recognized (unsigned 2-bit, ranging from 0x0 to 0x3).
      Defaults to 0, which is the configuration at power-up.

      1 LSB = 1 \* 1/ODR

  delta-threshold:
    type: int
    default: 0x0
    description: |
      Wake-up threshold (unsigned 6-bit, ranging from 0x0 to 0x3F).
      The threshold value is applicable to both positive and negative
      acceleration data. A wake-up event is recognized, if at least
      one of the acceleration axis values exceeds the threshold value.

      Defaults to 0, which is the configuration at power-up.

      1 LSB = 1/64 of measurement range (full scale).

  delta-offsets:
    type: array
    default: [0, 0, 0]
    description: |
      Wake-up X/Y/Z axis offsets (signed 8-bit, ranging from -128 to 127).
      Defaults to "<0>, <0>, <0>", which is the configuration at power-up.

      The weight of the offsets depends on the delta-offset-weight property.
      E.g. for delta-offset-weight=<1>, an offset value of 0x40 corresponds
      to approximately 1g.

  delta-offset-weight:
    type: int
    default: 0x0
    enum:
      - 0   # 0.977 mg/LSB
      - 1   # 15.6 mg/LSB
    description: |
      Wake-up offset weight (0 or 1).
      Weight of the offsets specified in the delta-offsets property.
      Defaults to 0, which is the configuration at power-up.

      A value of 0 corresponds to 0.977 mg/LSB, a value of 1
      corresponds to 15.6 mg/LSB.
