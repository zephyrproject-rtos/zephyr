  Silicon Labs Si7006 Humidity and Temperature Sensor

  This is compatible with a range of Silicon Labs sensors, such as the Si7013,
  Si7020, and Si7021.  This binding will use a slightly different (better)
  command to read temperature from the "sensirion,sht21" binding.

compatible: "silabs,si7006"

include: sensirion,sht21.yaml
