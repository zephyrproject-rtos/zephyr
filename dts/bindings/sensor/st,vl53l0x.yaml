  max-time-for-ranging:
    type: int
    default: 33000
    description: |
      Set max time for ranging in μs
      default value 33000 is 33ms
      The timing budget is the time allocated by the user to perform one range measurement.
      The API takes care of splitting this timing budget into dedicated sub steps in the
      ranging process.
      The user only has to set the overall timing budget in micro seconds, and the
      function allocates the timings internally. A check is performed to know which
      part of the scheduler is enabled or disabled, in order to maximize Final Range
      timing budget.
      VL53L0X_SetMeasurementTimingBudgetMicroSeconds() and
      VL53L0X_GetMeasurementTimingBudgetMicroSeconds()
      The default timing budget value is 33ms, while the minimum is 20ms.

  signal-limit-ratio:
    type: int
    default: 100
    description: |
      Specify a floating point value multiplied by 1000.
      For example, a value of 1 represents 0.001 in real value.
      default value 100 is set VL53L0X_SETUP_SIGNAL_LIMIT (0.1 * 65536)
      This represents the amplitude of the signal reflected from the
      target and detected by the device.

  sigma-limit-ratio:
    type: int
    default: 60000
    description: |
      Specify a floating point value multiplied by 1000.
      For example, a value of 1 represents 0.001 in real value.
      default value 60000 is set VL53L0X_SETUP_SIGMA_LIMIT (60 * 65536)
      Sigma is the time difference (shift) between the reference and
      return SPAD arrays.
      As Sigma represents time of flight and this translates to distance
