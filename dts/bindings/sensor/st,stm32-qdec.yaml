         Intensity of the filter applied to the input signal. This is
         implemented by scaling the sampling frequency and adding a counter
         in which N consecutive samples with same value are needed to validate
         a transition.
         Mapping is as follows (F_clk is the timer's clock):
         0: No filter, sampling is done at F_dts (default value)
         1: Fs = F_clk, N=2
         2: Fs = F_clk, N=4
         3: Fs = F_clk, N=8
         4: Fs = F_clk/2, N=6
         5: Fs = F_clk/2, N=8
         6: Fs = F_clk/4, N=6
         7: Fs = F_clk/4, N=8
         8: Fs = F_clk/8, N=6
         9: Fs = F_clk/8, N=8
         10: Fs = F_clk/16, N=5
         11: Fs = F_clk/16, N=6
         12: Fs = F_clk/16, N=8
         13: Fs = F_clk/32, N=5
         14: Fs = F_clk/32, N=6
         15: Fs = F_clk/32, N=8
         Default value is set by hardware at reset
       default: 0

         - 0  # No filter
