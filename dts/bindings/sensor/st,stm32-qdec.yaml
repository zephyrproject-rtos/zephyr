  st,encoder-mode:
    type: int
    description: |
      Set encoder mode.
      The following modes are supported:
      0x1: Encoder mode 1 (Default)
      0x2: Encoder mode 2
      0x3: Encoder mode 3
      Some MCUs supports additional modes:
      0x10002: Encoder mode: Clock plus direction, x2 mode
      0x10003: Encoder mode: Clock plus direction, x1 mode
      0x10004: Encoder mode: Directional Clock, x2 mode
      0x10005: Encoder mode: Directional Clock, x1 mode
      0x10006: Quadrature encoder mode: x1 mode, counting on tim_ti1fp1
      0x10007: Quadrature encoder mode: x1 mode, counting on tim_ti2fp2
      Default value complies with stm32 low level timer encoder init value.

  st,input-polarity-inverted:
    type: boolean
    description: Encoder is triggered by a falling edge on the input pin

  st,input-filter-level:
    type: int
    description: |
      Intensity of the filter applied to the input signal. This is
      implemented by scaling the sampling frequency and adding a counter
      in which N consecutive samples with same value are needed to validate
      a transition.
      Mapping is as follows (F_clk is the timer's clock):
      0: No filter, sampling is done at F_dts (default value)
      1: Fs = F_clk, N=2
      2: Fs = F_clk, N=4
      3: Fs = F_clk, N=8
      4: Fs = F_clk/2, N=6
      5: Fs = F_clk/2, N=8
      6: Fs = F_clk/4, N=6
      7: Fs = F_clk/4, N=8
      8: Fs = F_clk/8, N=6
      9: Fs = F_clk/8, N=8
      10: Fs = F_clk/16, N=5
      11: Fs = F_clk/16, N=6
      12: Fs = F_clk/16, N=8
      13: Fs = F_clk/32, N=5
      14: Fs = F_clk/32, N=6
      15: Fs = F_clk/32, N=8
      Default value is set by hardware at reset
    default: 0
    enum:
      - 0  # No filter
      - 1  # FDIV1_N2
      - 2  # FDIV1_N4

  st,counts-per-revolution:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      This is a number >= 1 that is used to determine how many revolutions
      were done based on the current counter's value.
