    description: Encoder is triggered by a falling edge on the input pin

  st,input-filter-level:
    type: int
    description: |
      Intensity of the filter applied to the input signal. This is
      implemented by scaling the sampling frequency and adding a counter
      in which N consecutive samples with same value are needed to validate
      a transition.
      Mapping is as follows (F_clk is the timer's clock):
      0: No filter, sampling is done at F_dts (default value)
      1: Fs = F_clk, N=2
      2: Fs = F_clk, N=4
      3: Fs = F_clk, N=8
      4: Fs = F_clk/2, N=6
      5: Fs = F_clk/2, N=8
      6: Fs = F_clk/4, N=6
      7: Fs = F_clk/4, N=8
      8: Fs = F_clk/8, N=6
      9: Fs = F_clk/8, N=8
      10: Fs = F_clk/16, N=5
      11: Fs = F_clk/16, N=6
      12: Fs = F_clk/16, N=8
      13: Fs = F_clk/32, N=5
      14: Fs = F_clk/32, N=6
      15: Fs = F_clk/32, N=8
      Default value is set by hardware at reset
    default: 0
