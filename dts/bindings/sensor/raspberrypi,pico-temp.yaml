      Vbe voltage in microvolts at 27 degrees C. Vbe = 0.706V typically.
      The temperature sensor measures the Vbe voltage of a biased bipolar diode.
      The temperature calculates from the Vbe voltage measured by the sensor
      using the following equation typical case.

        T = 27 - (ADC_Voltage - 0.706)/0.001721

      See also the vbe-slope section.

      The slope of Vbe voltage in microvolts per degree C.
      Typically, a slope of -1.721mV per degree.
