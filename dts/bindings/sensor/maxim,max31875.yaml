properties:
  conversions-per-second:
    description: |
      Number of temperature readings performed by the MAX31875 per second.
      0.25 conversions per second is the power-on reset configuration.
    type: string
    default: "0.25"
    # Note: the driver relies on the ordering of this enum,
    # so change it with care.
    enum:
      - "0.25"
      - "1"
      - "4"
      - "8"
  extended-mode:
    description: |
      When true, use 13-bit data format to allow for measuring
      temperatures > 128Â°C
    type: boolean
  resolution:
    description: |
      The number of bits used for each temperature sample.
      A resolution of 10 bits takes 35ms to convert.
      Each 1-bit increase doubles the conversion time.
      Similarly, each 1-bit decrease halves the conversion time.
      10 bits of resolution is the power-on reset configuration.
    type: int
    default: 10
    # Note: the driver relies on the ordering of this enum,
    # so change it with care.
    enum:   # Conversion time (ms)
      - 8   # 8.75
      - 9   # 17.5
      - 10  # 35
      - 12  # 140
