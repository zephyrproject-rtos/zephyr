    description: |
      Modbus slave address of the PZEM004T sensor (0x00 - 0xf7).
      Every sensor will answer to the default address 0xF8 if there is only one
      sensor connected to the bus. If there are multiple sensors, each one must
      have a different address. To set modbus address, each device has to be
      connected independently and snsor_attr_set has to be used for each device
      after which multiple devices with different addresses can be connected
      on the same bus.
