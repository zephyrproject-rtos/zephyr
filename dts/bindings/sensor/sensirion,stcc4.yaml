  Supported I2C addresses: 0x64(default)

properties:
  pressure:
    type: int
    default: 101300
    description: |
      Set the pressure compensation in pascal (Pa).
      Default: 101'300 Pa
  humidity-compensation:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      By default this option is not set and the SHT4x sensor is used for compensation.
      For manual compensation:
      - Set a compensation value for temperature and humidity in ticks.
        humidity ticks = (humidity + 6) * 65535 / 125
  temperature-compensation:
    type: int
    default: 0

      For manual compensation:
      - Set a compensation value for temperature and humidity in ticks.
        temperature ticks = (temperature + 45) * 65535 / 175
  do-perform-conditioning:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      The perform_conditioning command is recommended to improve sensor performance
      when the sensor has not completed measurements for more than 3 hours.
      Please note that conditioning takes 22 seconds.
