properties:
  resolution:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      Resolution of the measurement result
      0 = low resolution
      1 = high resolution
      2 = high resolution 2
      The default mode number 1 is mentioned
      in the datasheet as recommended by the
      sensor manufacturer. One should pick
      other mode, if higher or lower resolution
      is desired.

      - 0
      - 1
      - 2
  mtreg:
    type: int
    default: 69
    description: |
      Duration of single measurement process.
      The greater the value, the longer the duration
      and greater accuracy. After sensor power-on
      mtreg register is set to default value of
      this property (chosen by sensor manufacturer): 69.
      Valid values are in range 31-254 (inclusive).
