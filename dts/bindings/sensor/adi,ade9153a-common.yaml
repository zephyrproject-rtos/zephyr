      The CF1 pin is a Calibration Frequency (CF) Logic Output. The CF1 and CF2 outputs provide
      proportional power information based on the CFxSEL bits in the CFMODE register. Use these
      outputs for operational and calibration purposes. Scale the full-scale output frequency by
      writing to the CFxDEN registers, respectively.
