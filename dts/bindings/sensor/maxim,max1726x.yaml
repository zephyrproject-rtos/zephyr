    design-cap:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: Battery Capacity in mAh (default 3000)

    empty-voltage:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: Empty voltage target during load in mV (default 3300)

    recovery-voltage:
      type: int
      required: true

    charge-voltage:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: Charge voltage in mV

    hibernate-threshold:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 7
      description: |
          Used to set the threshold level (in mA) for entering or exiting
          hibernate mode. The threshold is defined by the following equation:
          threshold (mA) = (FullCap(mAh) / 0.8hrs) / 2 ^ (hibernate-threshold).
          Value must be betweew 0 and 15.
          Hardware default to 7 at startup.

    hibernate-scalar:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 4
      description: |
          Used to set the task period while in hibernate mode. The task period is
          defined by the following equation:
          Task Period (s) = 351ms x 2 ^ (hibernate-scalar).
          Value must be between 0 and 7.
          Hardware default to 4 at startup.

    hibernate-exit-time:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 3
      description: |
          Used to set the required time period of consecutive current readings
          above the hib-threshold value before the IC exits hibernate and return
          to active mode of operation. The exit time is defined by the following
          equation:
          Exit Time (s) = (hibernate-exit-time+1) x 702ms x 2 ^ (hibernate-scalar).
          Value must be between 0 and 3.
          Hardware default to 3 at startup.

    hibernate-enter-time:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 0
      description: |
          Used to set the time period that consecutive current readings must
          remain below the hib-threshold value before the IC enters hibernate
          mode. The enter time is defined by the following equation:
          2.812s x 2 ^ (hibernate-enter-time) < Entry Time < 2.812s x 2 ^ (hibernate-enter-time + 1).
          Value must be between 0 and 7.
          Hardware default to 0 at startup.
