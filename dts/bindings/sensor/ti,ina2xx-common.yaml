      This value should be selected so that measurement resolution is
      maximized, that is:

        current-lsb(A) = maximum expected current(A) / 2^15

      (sensor has 15 bits). For example, if maximum expected current is 15A:

        current-lsb(A) = 15A / 2^15 ~= 457uA

      Rounded values may be used for convenience, e.g. 500uA/LSB or 1mA/LSB
      while keeping a good measurement resolution. The units are in uA/LSB
      so that low maximum currents can be measured with enough resolution.
