properties:
    int1-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        The INT1 signal defaults to active high as produced by the
        sensor.  The property value should ensure the flags properly
        describe the signal that is presented to the driver.

    wakeup-mode:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        This mode is intended for extremely low power consumption,
        checking for motion only about six times a second.

    autosleep:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Enter Wake-Up mode when inactivity is detected,
        reenter Measurement mode when activity is detected.
        Only applies for Linked and Loop mode, ignored otherwise.
