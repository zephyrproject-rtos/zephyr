properties:
  mdm-power-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: GPIO for modem power control

  mdm-reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: GPIO for modem reset

  mdm-wake-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: GPIO for modem wake

  mdm-dtr-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      GPIO for modem data terminal ready.

      Asserted (logical high) when UART is active and
      deasserted (logical low) when UART is inactive, powered down or in low power mode.

  cmux-enable-runtime-power-save:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable runtime power saving using CMUX PSC commands.
      This requires modem to support CMUX and PSC commands while keeping the data
      connection active.

  cmux-close-pipe-on-power-save:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Close the modem pipe when entering power save mode.
      When runtime power management is enabled, this closes the UART.
      This requires modem to support waking up the UART using RING signal.

  cmux-idle-timeout-ms:
    type: int
    description: Time in milliseconds after which CMUX will enter power save mode.
    default: 10000
