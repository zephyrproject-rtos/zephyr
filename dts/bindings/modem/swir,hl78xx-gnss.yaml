  Binding for a modem child node that indicates the modem supports
  GNSS functionality. This node is intended to be a child of a modem
  device node (for example, `modem: hl_modem { ... };`).

  The binding is intentionally small and extensible; it documents a
  presence node (compatible = "swir,hl78xx-gnss") and may be extended
  in future with additional properties that the driver may consume.

compatible: "swir,hl78xx-gnss"

include:
  - uart-device.yaml
  - gnss-nmea-generic.yaml
  - gnss-pps.yaml

properties:
  fix-rate:
    type: int
    default: 1000
    description: |
      Initial fix-rate GNSS modem will be operating on. May be adjusted at
      run-time through GNSS APIs. Must be greater than 50-ms.
      Default is power-on setting.
