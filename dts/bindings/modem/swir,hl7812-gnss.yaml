  Binding for a modem offload child node that indicates the modem
  supports socket offload functionality. This node is intended to be a
  child of a modem device node (for example, `modem: hl_modem { ... };`).

  The binding is intentionally small and extensible; it documents a
  presence node (compatible = "swir,hl7812-offload") and may be extended
  in future with additional properties that the driver may consume.

compatible: "swir,hl7812-gnss"

include: swir,hl78xx-gnss.yaml
