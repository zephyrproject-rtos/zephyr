  Binding for a modem child node that indicates the modem supports
  socket offloading. This node is intended to be a child of a modem
  device node (for example, `modem: hl_modem { ... };`).

  The binding is intentionally small and extensible; it documents a
  presence node (compatible = "net,offload-modem-sockets") and a couple
  of optional integer properties that the driver may consume.

compatible: "swir,hl78xx-offload"

properties:
  max-data-length:
    type: int
    description: |
      "Maximum length of a single data payload (bytes) that
      the modem can send/receive in one offload operation."
    enum:
      - 512
      - 1024
      - 2048
      - 4096
      - 8192

  offload-priority:
    type: int
    description: |
      "Priority of this offload modem compared to other offload
      modems in the system. Lower values indicate higher priority.
      The system will prefer to use the offload modem with the
      highest priority (lowest value) when multiple offload modems
      are available."
