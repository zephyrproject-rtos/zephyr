description: Microchip MCP4728 12-bit 4-channel DAC

compatible: "microchip,mcp4728"

include: [dac-controller.yaml, i2c-device.yaml]

properties:
  "#io-channel-cells":
    const: 1

  voltage-reference:
    type: array
    required: true
    description: |
      DAC voltage reference select.
      0 - Vdd
      1 - Internal voltage reference (2.048V)
      Note: array entries correspond to the successive channels

  power-down-mode:
    type: array
    required: true
    description: |
      Power-down mode select.
      0 - normal mode
      1 - Vout is loaded with 1 kOhm resistor to ground
      2 - Vout is loaded 100 kOhm resistor to ground
      3 - Vout is loaded with 500 kOhm resistor to ground
      Note: with values bigger than 0 most of channel circuits are powered off
      Note: array entries correspond to the successive channels

  gain:
    type: array
    default: [0, 0, 0, 0]
    description: |
      Gain selection bit.
      0 = x1 (gain of 1)
      1 = x2 (gain of 2)
      Note: applicable only when internal Vref is selected
      Note: array entries correspond to the successive channels
