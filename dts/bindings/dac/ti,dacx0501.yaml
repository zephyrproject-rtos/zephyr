description: TI DACx0501 12 to 16 bit DAC series for DAC60501, DAC70501 and DAC80501 devices.

compatible: "ti,dacx0501"

properties:
  voltage-reference:
    type: string
    required: true
    enum:
      - "internal"
      - "external"
    description: |
      DAC voltage reference select: either internal (2.5 V) or external

  output-gain:
    type: string
    required: true
    enum:
      - "mul2"
      - "mul1"
      - "div2"
    description: |
      This setting can be used to control the output voltage range within the supported bit
      resolution. mul2 will double the output range but lower the resolution, while div2 will
      lower the range but double the resolution.
