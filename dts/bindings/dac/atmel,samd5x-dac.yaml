  Atmel SAMD5x/E5x family DAC

  To enable the DAC peripheral, it must be enabled in the board dts, or in
  subsequent overlay file. In addition, each channel must be configured
  using the child-binding properties.

  &dac0 {
    status = "okay";
    reference = "intref";

    channel_0 {
      oversampling = <0>;
      refresh-period = <1>;
      current-control = <2>;
    };

    channel_1 {
      oversampling = <0>;
      refresh-period = <1>;
      current-control = <2>;
    };
  };

child-binding:
  description: |
    DAC Channel configuration. Each channel can be individually configured
    with the following properties:

  properties:
    oversampling:
      type: string
      description: |
        This field defines the oversampling ratio/interpolation depth:
        - 0: 1x oversampling (no interpolation)
        - 1: 2x oversampling
        - 2: 4x oversampling
        - 3: 8x oversampling
        - 4: 16x oversampling
        - 5: 32x oversampling
        Higher oversampling ratios provide better noise reduction but
        reduce the maximum update rate.
      enum:
        - "OSR_1"
        - "OSR_2"
        - "OSR_4"
        - "OSR_8"
        - "OSR_16"
        - "OSR_32"

    refresh-period:
      type: int
      description: |
        Defines the refresh period for the DAC output. Only work when the
        input data is not interpolated, i.e. the oversampling rate is zero.
        - 0: Refresh mode disabled
        - 1-15: Refresh period = REFRESH * 30µs

    run-in-standby:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        When enabled, the DAC channel continues to operate in standby mode.

    current-control:
      type: string
      description: |
        Select the output buffer current according to data rate, power
        consumption can be reduced by controlling the output buffer
        current, according to conversion rate.
        - 0: GCLK_DAC ≤ 1.2MHz (100kSPS)
        - 1: 1.2MHz < GCLK_DAC ≤ 6MHz (500kSPS)
        - 2: 6MHz < GCLK_DAC ≤ 12MHz (1MSPS)
      enum:
        - "CC100K"
        - "CC1M"
