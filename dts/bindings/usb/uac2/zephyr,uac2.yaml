description: USB Audio Class 2 instance

compatible: "zephyr,uac2"

# Child nodes of "zephyr,uac2" compatibles are supposed to be Audio Control
# entities, i.e. clock sources, input terminals, output terminals, etc.
# After all Audio Control entities, the Audio Streaming interface compatibles
# should follow (as child nodes of "zephyr,uac2").
#
# The only reason for putting Audio Streaming interfaces at the end is because
# Audio Control entities derive their unique ID from child index (+ 1). For most
# cases the order shouldn't really matter, but if there happen to be maximum
# possible number of entities (255) then the Audio Streaming would inadvertently
# "consume" one of the available IDs.
