      Defines the CPU clock source, each corresponding to different frequencies:
      - 0: ESP32_CPU_CLK_SRC_XTAL - Uses the external crystal clock typically at 40 MHz.
      - 1: ESP32_CPU_CLK_SRC_PLL - Utilizes an internal PLL which operates at either
      320 MHz or 480 MHz.
      - 2: ESP32_CPU_CLK_SRC_RC_FAST - Employs an internal fast RC oscillator with
      frequency of 17.5 MHz.
