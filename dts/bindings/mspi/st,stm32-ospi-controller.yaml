  dmas:
    description: |
      Optional DMA channel specifier, required for DMA transactions.

      For example dmas for TX/RX on MSPI
         dmas = <&dma1 5 41 0x10000>;

  dma-names:
    description: DMA channel name.
    enum:
      - "tx_rx"

  st,dlyb-bypass:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enables Delay Block (DLYB) Bypass.

  st,ssht-enable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enables Sample Shifting half-cycle.

      It is recommended to be enabled in STR mode and disabled in DTR mode.

  st,io-low-port:
    type: string
    enum:
      - "IOPORT_NONE"
      - "IOPORT_1_LOW"
      - "IOPORT_1_HIGH"
      - "IOPORT_2_LOW"
      - "IOPORT_2_HIGH"
    description: |
      Specifies which port of the OCTOSPI IO Manager is used for the IO[3:0] pins.

      If absent, then `IOPORT_<n>_LOW` is used where `n` is the OSPI
      instance number.

      Note: You might need to enable the OCTOSPI I/O manager clock to use the
            property. Please refer to Reference Manual.
            The clock can be enabled in the devicetree.

  st,io-high-port:
    type: string
    enum:
      - "IOPORT_NONE"
      - "IOPORT_1_LOW"
      - "IOPORT_1_HIGH"
      - "IOPORT_2_LOW"
      - "IOPORT_2_HIGH"
    description: |
      Specifies which port of the OCTOSPI IO Manager is used for the IO[7:4] pins.

      If absent, then `IOPORT_<n>_HIGH` is used where `n` is the OSPI
      instance number.

      Can be set to `IOPORT_NONE` for Single SPI, Dual SPI and Quad SPI.

      Note: You might need to enable the OCTOSPI I/O manager clock to use the
            property. Please refer to Reference Manual.
            The clock can be enabled in the devicetree.

  st,clk-port:
    type: int
    enum:
      - 1
      - 2
    description: |
      Specifies which port of the OCTOSPI IO Manager is used for the clk pin.

      If absent, then n is used where `n` is the OSPI
      instance number.

      Note: You might need to enable the OCTOSPI I/O manager clock to use the
            property. Please refer to Reference Manual.
            The clock can be enabled in the devicetree.

  st,dqs-port:
    type: int
    enum:
      - 1
      - 2
    description: |
      Specifies which port of the OCTOSPI IO Manager is used for the dqs pin.

      If absent, then n is used where `n` is the OSPI
      instance number.

      Note: You might need to enable the OCTOSPI I/O manager clock to use the
            property. Please refer to Reference Manual.
            The clock can be enabled in the devicetree.

  st,ncs-port:
    type: int
    enum:
      - 1
      - 2
    description: |
      Specifies which port of the OCTOSPI IO Manager is used for the ncs pin.

      If absent, then n is used where `n` is the OSPI
      instance number.

      Note: You might need to enable the OCTOSPI I/O manager clock to use the
            property. Please refer to Reference Manual.
            The clock can be enabled in the devicetree.
