    STM32 XSPI controller
    Enabling a stm32 xspi node in a board
    description would typically requires this: (pinning depends on the stm32 mcu)

        &xspi {
            pinctrl-0 = <&octospi_clk_pe9 &octospi_ncs_pe10 &octospi_dqs_pe11
                         &octospi_io0_pe12 &octospi_io1_pe13

  dmas:
    description: |
      Optional DMA channel specifier, required for DMA transactions.
      For example dmas for TX/RX on xspi
         dmas = <&dma1 5 41 0x10000>;

      With, in each cell of the dmas specifier:
      - &dma1: dma controller phandle
      - 5: channel number (0 to Max-Channel minus 1). From 0 to 15 on stm32u5x.
      - 41: slot number (request which could be given by the DMAMUX)
      - 0x10000: channel configuration (only for srce/dest data size, priority)

      Notes:
        - On series supporting DMAMUX, the DMA phandle should be provided
          but DMAMUX node should also be enabled in the DTS.
        - For channel configuration, only the config bits priority and
          periph/mem datasize are used. The periph/mem datasize must be equal,
          0 is a correct value.
         - There is no Fifo used by this DMA peripheral.

      For example dmas for TX/RX on xspi
         dmas = <&dma1 5 41 0x10000>;

  dma-names:
    description: |
      DMA channel name. If DMA should be used, expected value is "tx_rx".

      For example
         dma-names = "tx_rx";

  ssht-enable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enables Sample Shifting half-cycle.

      It is recommended to be enabled in STR mode and disabled in DTR mode.
