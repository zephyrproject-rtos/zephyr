include: [mspi-controller.yaml, pinctrl-device.yaml]

properties:
  reg:
    required: true
    description: |
      Address and length of the MSPI configuration register and the indirect
      write FIFO location.

  sram-allocated-for-read:
    required: true
    type: int
    description: |
      Amount of SRAM that is allocated for read data from the MSPI bus. The rest
      is allocated for data written to the MSPI bus.
      The value needs to be between 0 and 255

  init-nss-delay:
    type: int
    description: |
      Amount of clock cycles between the CS pin is deasserted between
      transactions after startup. Can be changed during runtime via the timing
      config

  init-btwn-delay:
    type: int
    description: |
      Amount of clock cycles no peripheral is selected during switching device
      after startup. Can be changed during runtime via the timing config

  init-after-delay:
    type: int
    description: |
      Amount of clock cycles the CS pin is continue being held after the last
      bit was transferred. Can be changed during runtime via the timing config

  init-init-delay:
    type: int
    description: |
      Amount of clock cycles is asserted before sending the first bit of the
      transmission. Can be changed during runtime via the timing config
