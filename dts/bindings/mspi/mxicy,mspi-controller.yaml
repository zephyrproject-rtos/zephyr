description: Macronix MSPI controller

bus: mspi

compatible: "mxicy,mspi-controller"

include: [mspi-controller.yaml, pinctrl-device.yaml]

properties:
  reg:
    required: true
  clock-frequency:
    required: true
    type: int
    description: |
      Clock frequency the SPI peripheral is being driven at, in Hz.
  ce-ports:
    required: true
    type: uint8-array
    description: |
      Specifies the CE port number used for device communication.

      Example:

        mspi@... {
                ce-gpios = [00, 01, 02, 03];

                mspi-device@0 {
                        reg = <0>;
                        ...
                };
                mspi-device@1 {
                        reg = <1>;
                        ...
                };
                ...
        };

      The child node "mspi-device@0" specifies a mspi device with
      chip select controller ce-port 0. Similarly, "mspi-device@1" has CE GPIO
      controller ce-port 1. Additional devices can be configured in the same way.
      This controller supports up to 256 devices.
