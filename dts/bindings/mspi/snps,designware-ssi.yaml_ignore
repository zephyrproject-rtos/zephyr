    description: |
      Activates auxiliary register access that is needed on some platforms.

  fifo-depth:
    required: true
    type: int
    description: |
      Number of items that can be stored in the TX FIFO. Range: 8-256.
      If the RX FIFO depth is not specified separately in the rx-fifo-depth
      property, this value specifies depth of both TX and RX FIFOs.

  rx-fifo-depth:
    type: int
    description: |
      Number of items that can be stored in the RX FIFO. Range: 8-256.

  tx-fifo-threshold:
    type: int
    description: |
      Number of entries in the TX FIFO above which the TX transfer is started.
      Maximum value is the TX FIFO depth - 1.

  rx-fifo-threshold:
    type: int
    description: |
      Number of entries in the RX FIFO above which the controller gets an RX
      interrupt. Maximum value is the RX FIFO depth - 1.
