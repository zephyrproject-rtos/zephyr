  aux-reg-enable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Activates auxiliary register access that is needed on some platforms.

  fifo-depth:
    required: true
    type: int
    description: |
      Number of items that can be stored in the TX FIFO. Range: 8-256.
      If the RX FIFO depth is not specified separately in the rx-fifo-depth
      property, this value specifies depth of both TX and RX FIFOs.

  rx-fifo-depth:
    type: int
    description: |
      Number of items that can be stored in the RX FIFO. Range: 8-256.

  tx-fifo-threshold:
    type: int
    description: |
      Number of entries in the TX FIFO above which the TX transfer is started.
      Maximum value is the TX FIFO depth - 1.

  rx-fifo-threshold:
    type: int
    description: |
      Number of entries in the RX FIFO above which the controller gets an RX
      interrupt. Maximum value is the RX FIFO depth - 1.

  dma-transmit-data-level:
    type: int
    description: |
      When in DMA mode, the transmit data level field controls the level at which a DMA request
      is made by the transmit logic. A request to transmit is generated when the number of
      valid data entries in the transmit FIFO is equal to or below this field value. Lower values
      mean less frequent DMA triggers with larger bursts. Higher values mean fewer, smaller bursts
      (lower latency, higher overhead). Range: 0-15

  dma-receive-data-level:
    type: int
    description: |
      When in DMA mode, the receive data level field controls the level at which a DMA request
      is made by the receive logic. A request to receive is generated when the number of
      valid data entries in the receive FIFO is greater than this value. Lower values mean
      more frequent DMA triggers and higher values mean larger less frequent bursts. Range: 0-15
