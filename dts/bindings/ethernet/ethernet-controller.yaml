properties:
  local-mac-address:
    type: uint8-array
    description: Specifies the MAC address that was assigned to the network device

  zephyr,random-mac-address:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Use a random MAC address generated when the driver is initialized.
      Note that using this choice and rebooting a board may leave stale
      MAC address in peers' ARP caches and lead to issues and delays in
      communication.  (Use "ip neigh flush all" on Linux peers to clear
      ARP cache.)

      It is driver specific how the OUI octets are handled.

      If set we ignore any setting of the local-mac-address property.

  phy-handle:
    type: phandle
    description: |
      Specifies a reference to a node representing a PHY device.

  phy-connection-type:
    type: string
    description: |
      Specifies the interface connection type between ethernet MAC and PHY.
    enum:
      - "mii"
      - "rmii"
      - "gmii"
