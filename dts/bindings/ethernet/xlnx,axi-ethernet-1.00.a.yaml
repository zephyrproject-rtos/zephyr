    description: Xilinx AXI Ethernet has an optional interrupt for updating statistics.

  reg:
    description:
      Control registers of the MDIO device are also used for the Ethernet MAC controller.
      Thus, both devices should have a parent node with compatible "xlnx,axi-ethernet-subsystem-7.2"
      which defines the reg property, and MAC and MDIO should NOT have a reg property.
