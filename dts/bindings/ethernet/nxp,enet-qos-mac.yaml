      Use part of the unique silicon ID to generate the MAC.
      This property will be overridden if the node has
      zephyr,random-mac-address or local-mac-address also.
      This option is intended for cases where a very low likelihood
      that the mac address is the same as another on the network
      is sufficient, such as, testing, bringup, demos, etc.
      The first 3 bytes will be the freescale OUI and the next
      3 bytes will come from the chip's unique ID.
