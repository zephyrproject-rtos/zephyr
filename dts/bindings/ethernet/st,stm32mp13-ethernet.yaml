  STM32MP13 Ethernet

  This binding file describes the device tree properties required to configure
  and use the Ethernet controller on STM32MP13 series microprocessor.

compatible: "st,stm32mp13-ethernet"

include:
  - "st,stm32-ethernet-common.yaml"
  - "memory-region.yaml"

properties:
  memory-regions:
    required: true
    description: |
      Memory region in which the Ethernet DMA lists and data buffers will be
      placed. The memory region has to be non-cacheable and accessible by the
      Ethernet peripheral.
  st,ext-phyclk:
    type: boolean
    description:
      Set this property in RMII mode when you have PHY without crystal 50MHz and want to
      select RCC clock instead of ETH_REF_CLK, or in RGMII mode when you want to select
      RCC clock instead of ETH_CLK125.
