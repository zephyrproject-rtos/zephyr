      Clocks must be given corresponding names so that the shim driver can recognize them.
      "gwcaclk": operating clock for gateway CPU agent
      "pclk": peripheral clock for COMA and PTP timer
      "eswclk": operating clock for ethernet switch module
      "eswphyclk": operating clock for xMII interface
      "ethphyclk": operating clock for ETHPHYLCK pin output. Enable this clock if any PHY
      device use ETHPHYCLK pin output as clock source.
