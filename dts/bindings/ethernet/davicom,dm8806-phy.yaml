      5-bit PHY address for Internal PHY Registers group of Davicom DM8806 MAC
      PHY Ethernet Switch Controller, separate for each MAC PHY, build in DM8806
      and correlate with Ethenet port. DM8806 has five MAC PHY inside, but it is
      not mandatory to define all of them in device tree if there is no need to
      communicate with all of them. Each MAC PHY has its own PHY address, which
      together with Register address creates the absolute address of the
      concrete register in conrete MAC PHY acoring to Clause 22 MDIO
      communication standard. Below example shows how the PHY address and
      Register address are glued together in Internal PHY Registers group:

                        Internal PHY Registers
      Port0: (5-bit PHY Address) + (5-bit Register address) = Absolute address

      Absolute address is the address of the concrete register in MAC PHY0
      which is responsible for Ethernet Port0 in Davicom DM8806

      Absolute address is the address of the concrete register in MAC PHY0
