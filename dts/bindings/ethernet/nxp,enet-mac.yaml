properties:
  interrupts:
    required: true

  nxp,mdio:
    type: phandle
    required: true

      Corresponding mdio device

  nxp,ptp-clock:
    type: phandle
    required: true
    description: |
      Corresponding ptp clock device

  nxp,unique-mac:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Use part of the unique silicon ID to generate the MAC.
      This property will be overridden if the node has
      zephyr,random-mac-address or local-mac-address also.
      This option is intended for cases where a very low likelihood
      that the mac address is the same as another on the network
      is sufficient, such as, testing, bringup, demos, etc.
      The first 3 bytes will be the freescale OUI and the next
      3 bytes will come from the chip's unique ID.

  nxp,fused-mac:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Use the MAC address from fuse shadow register.
      Not all platforms have a fusable MAC address.
