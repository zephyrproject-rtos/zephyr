    STM32 Digital Camera Memory Interface Pixel Processor (DCMIPP).

    Example of node configuration at board level:

    &dcmipp {
      status = "okay";

      ports {
        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <0>;

        port@0 {
          reg = <0>;
          dcmipp_ep_in: endpoint {
            remote-endpoint-label = "imx335_ep_out";
            data-lanes = <1 2>;
          };
        };
      };
    };
