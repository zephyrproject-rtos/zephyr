  HM0360 CMOS video sensor.

  Example of node configuration:

  &i2c4
  {
    status = "okay";
    hm0360: hm0360@24{
      compatible = "himax,hm0360";
      reg = <0x24>;
      status = "okay";
      reset-gpios = <&gpiod 4 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
      pwdn-gpios = <&gpioa 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
      port {
        hm0360_ep_out: endpoint {
          remote-endpoint-label = "video_pio_dma_ep_in";
        };
      };
    };
  };

compatible: "himax,hm0360"

properties:
  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      The RESETn pin is asserted to disable the sensor causing a hard
      reset. The sensor receives this as an active-low signal.
  pwdn-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      The PWRDN or PWDN pin is asserted to power down the sensor. The sensor
      receives this as an active high signal
