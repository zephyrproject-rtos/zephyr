description: OV2640 CMOS video sensor

compatible: "ovti,ov2640"

properties:
  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      The RESETn pin is asserted to disable the sensor causing a hard
      reset.  The sensor receives this as an active-low signal.

  clock-rate-control:
    type: int
    default: 0x87
    description: |
      Define the value to the Clock Rate Control register. By changing
      the system clock divide ratio and PLL, the frame rate and pixel
      rate will change together.
      Bit[7]    Internal frequency doublers ON/OFF selection.
                0: ON       1: OFF
      Bit[6]    Reserved
      Bit[5:0]  Clock divider.

      CLK = XVCLK /(decimal value of CLKRC[5:0] + 1)
