    Himax HM01B0 video sensor.

    Example of node configuration:

    &i2c0 {
      status = "okay";
      hm01b0: hm01b0@24 {
        compatible = "himax,hm01b0";
        reg = <0x24>;
        status = "okay";
        data-bits = <0x4>;
        port {
          hm01b0_ep_out: endpoint {
            remote-endpoint-label = "video_pio_dma_ep_in";
          };
        };
      };
    };

compatible: "himax,hm01b0"
properties:
  data-bits:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      Camera output data width. 1/4/8 bits.
      The default output data width value is 1, pixel value is serialised.
    enum: [1, 4, 8]
  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      The RESETn pin is asserted to disable the sensor causing a hard
      reset. The sensor receives this as an active-low signal.
  pwdn-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      The PWDN pin is asserted to power down the sensor. The sensor
      receives this as an active high signal
