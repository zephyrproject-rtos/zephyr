      Selects how the GPT counter behaves on compare events.
      - restart(default): When the counter reaches the Compare Channel 1 value,
        the counter resets to 0x00000000 and starts counting again.
      - free-run: Compare events do not reset the counter.
      Notes:
      - This driver uses Compare Channel 1 for the Zephyr counter alarm.
      - With restart, using alarms may cause the counter to reset at the
        alarm compare point.
    enum:
      - restart
      - free-run
    default: restart
