     PWM Slice used by the counter (value 0-7) and thus the channel id. Using other pwm devices
     connected to this slice leads to undefined behavior. Slice 0 is connected to channels 0 and 1,
     slice 1 to 2 and 3 and so on. While the physical pins can be used for other tasks, PWM usage
     would lead to undefined behaviour. The PWM pincontrol macros are also a source of information,
     as the number directly after PWM_ is the slice used by this channel.
