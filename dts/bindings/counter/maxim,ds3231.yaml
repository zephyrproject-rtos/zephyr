      32 KiHz open drain output

      The DS3231 defaults to providing a 32 KiHz square wave on this
      signal.  The driver does not make use of this, but applications
      may want access.

      interrupt/square wave open drain output

      The DS3231 uses this signal to notify when an alarm has triggered,
      and also to produce a square wave aligned to the countdown chain.
      Both capabilities are used within the driver.  This signal must be
      present to support time set and read operations that preserve
      sub-second accuracy.
