        ESP32 general-purpose timers.

        Each Timer is part of a Timer Group and the number of available Timers
        is SoC-dependent.

        As as example, ESP32 has 4 Timers available, which are split in two
        different groups (TIM0_G0, TIM1_G0, TIM0_G1 and TIM1_G1).

        In order to use one of the available timers on your application add
        a <board>.overlay file with contents as below

          &timer0 {
                  status = "okay";
                  prescaler = <10>;
          };

        From the above, setting 'status' is required while the prescaler is
        optional. Check below for more information on the prescaler.

properties:
  group:
    description: |
      The Timer Group index to which a timer belongs.
    type: int
    required: true
    enum:
    - 0
    - 1

  index:
    description: |
      The index that identifies a timer within a Timer Group.
    type: int
    required: true
    enum:
    - 0
    - 1

  prescaler:
    description: |
      The prescaler value defines the factor by which the APB clock will be
      divided. The outcome of which serves as clock reference to the Timer
      itself.

      The allowed values for this property are in the range [2..65535].
      Values above that range will be 16-bit-masked. Values 0 and 1 will be
      forced to 2.
    type: int
    default: 2
