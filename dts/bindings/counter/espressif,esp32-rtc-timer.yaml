        Espressif's Counter Driver based on RTC Main Timer.

        Any reset/sleep mode, except for the power-up reset, will not
        stop or reset the RTC Timer. This behavior may be handy when
        supporting applications that need to keep a timing baseline on
        such situations.

        There is also no need to enable the RTC Timer node, it starts
        running from power-up.
