compatible: "nxp,lptmr"

include: rtc.yaml

properties:
  reg:
    required: true

  clock-frequency:
    required: true
    description: Counter clock frequency

  prescaler:
    required: true
    description: The frequency of the counter is divided by this value.

  clk-source:
    type: int
    required: true
    enum: [0, 1, 2, 3]
    description: |
      Selects the clock to be used by the LPMTR prescaler/glitch filter.
      In time counter mode, this field selects the input clock to the prescaler.
      In pulse counter mode, this field selects the input clock to the glitch filter.
      The clock connections vary by device, see the device reference manual for
      more details.

  input-pin:
    type: int
    description: |
      When LPTMR is in Pulse mode, this value
      will be used to determine the "rising-edge
      source pin" to increment the lptmr counter.

  active-low:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      When LPTMR is in Pulse mode, this value
      will set the counter to active low.

  resolution:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Represents the width of the counter in bits.

  prescale-glitch-filter:
    type: int
    default: 1
    enum: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
    description: |
      When in prescaler mode, the counter is incremented every
        2 ^ [prescaler-glitch-filter] clock cycles.
      When in pulse mode, the counter is incremented every
        2 ^ [prescaler-glitch-filter] rising edges detected
        by the pin configured from the input-pin value.
        Note, that the pulse mode cannot be 2 ^ 16.

  timer-mode-sel:
    type: int
    enum: [0, 1]
    default: 0
    description: |
      This value determines rather the LPTMR is configured
      for Time-Counter mode or for Pulse mode.
      0 <- LPTMR is configured for Time Counter Mode.
      1 <- LPTMR is configured for Pulse Mode.

  wakeup-line:
    type: int
    description: |
      On some NXP platforms, LPTMR can wake up the MCU from
      lowpower mode, but the wakeup capability is configured
      through a specific peripheral, such as the wakeup unit.
      There is a special register in wakeup uint to configure
      the wake-up function of LPTMR. The location of this
      register is SoC specific. The user needs to specify the
      index of the register through this property.
