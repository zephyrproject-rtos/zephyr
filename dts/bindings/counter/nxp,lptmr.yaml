compatible: "nxp,lptmr"

include: rtc.yaml

properties:
  reg:
    required: true

  clock-frequency:
    required: true
    description: Counter clock frequency

  prescaler:
    type: int
    deprecated: true
    description: |
      This property has been deprecated and replaced by prescale-glitch-filter.
      It no longer has any functional impact. Any value assigned to this property
      will be disregarded. Consequently, the prescaler will be bypassed.

  clk-source:
    type: int
    required: true
    enum: [0, 1, 2, 3]
    description: |
      Selects the clock to be used by the LPMTR prescaler/glitch filter.
      In time counter mode, this field selects the input clock to the prescaler.
      In pulse counter mode, this field selects the input clock to the glitch filter.
      The clock connections vary by device, see the device reference manual for
      more details.

  input-pin:
    type: int
    description: |
      When LPTMR is in Pulse mode, this value
      will be used to determine the "rising-edge
      source pin" to increment the lptmr counter.

  active-low:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      When LPTMR is in Pulse mode, this value
      will set the counter to active low.

  resolution:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Represents the width of the counter in bits.

  prescale-glitch-filter:
    type: int
    default: 0
    enum: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
    description: |
      When in prescaler mode, if prescale-glitch-filter is 0, the prescaler
        is bypassed, the selected prescaler clock increments Counter (CNR) on every
        clock cycle. Otherwise the counter is incremented every
        2 ^ [prescaler-glitch-filter] clock cycles.
      When in pulse mode, if prescale-glitch-filter is 0, the glitch filter
        is bypassed, the selected input source increments the value of Counter(CNR)
        every time it asserts. Otherwise the counter is incremented every
        2 ^ [prescaler-glitch-filter] rising edges detected by the pin configured
        from the input-pin value.
      Note, that the pulse mode cannot be 2 ^ 16.

  timer-mode-sel:
    type: int
    enum: [0, 1]
    default: 0
    description: |
      This value determines rather the LPTMR is configured
      for Time-Counter mode or for Pulse mode.
      0 <- LPTMR is configured for Time Counter Mode.
      1 <- LPTMR is configured for Pulse Mode.
