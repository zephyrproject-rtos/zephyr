title: Microchip TCC G1 timer counter peripheral.

description: |
  Microchip TCC G1 timer counter peripheral.

  This peripheral is used for generating PWM signals.
  This compatible string is to be used for the following peripherals:
    - module name="TCC" id="U2213" version="3.1.0"

compatible: "microchip,tcc-g1"

include:
  - name: base.yaml
  - name: pinctrl-device.yaml

properties:
  reg:
    description: |
      Specifies the base address and size of the register set for the timer counter peripheral.
    required: true

  interrupts:
    description: |
      Defines the interrupt lines used by the timer counter peripheral.

      This property specifies the interrupt number and priority.
    required: true

  clocks:
    description: |
      Specifies the clock sources and their configurations for the timer counter peripheral.

      This property ensures the peripheral is provided with the necessary clock signals.
    required: true

  prescaler:
    type: int
    description: |
      Timer prescaler values.

      The prescaler divides the input clock frequency to
      achieve the desired timer frequency.
    enum:
      - 1
      - 2
      - 4
      - 8
      - 16
      - 64
      - 256
      - 1024

  channels:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      This specifies the maximum number of channels available for the peripheral instance.

  max-bit-width:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Maximum bit width supported by the counter.

      This property specifies the resolution of the counter. The value provided in the device tree
      should reflect the maximum supported by the hardware instance. It should only be overridden
      after consulting the relevant family datasheet to ensure compatibility.
    enum:
      - 16
      - 24
