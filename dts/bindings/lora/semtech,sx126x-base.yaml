properties:
  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      GPIO connected to the modem's NRESET signal.

      This signal is open-drain, active-low as interpreted by the
      modem.

  busy-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      GPIO connected to the modem's BUSY signal.

  antenna-enable-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Antenna power enable pin.

  tx-enable-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Antenna switch TX enable GPIO. If set, the driver tracks the
      state of the radio and controls the RF switch.

  rx-enable-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Antenna switch RX enable GPIO. If set, the driver tracks the
      state of the radio and controls the RF switch.

  dio1-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      GPIO connected to DIO1. This GPIO will be used as a generic
      IRQ line from the chip.

  dio2-tx-enable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Use DIO2 to drive an RF switch selecting between the TX and RX
      paths. When enabled, DIO2 goes high when the chip is
      transmitting.

  dio3-tcxo-voltage:
    type: int
    description: |
      TCXO supply voltage controlled by DIO3 if present.

      See constants in dt-bindings/lora/sx126x.h.

  tcxo-power-startup-delay-ms:
    type: int
    description: |
      Startup delay to let the TCXO stabilize after TCXO power on.

  rx-boosted:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable RX boosted mode, which increases the power consumption of
      RX mode by ~2mA in exchange for ~3dB sensitivity improvement.
