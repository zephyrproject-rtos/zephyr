    reset-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: |
        GPIO connected to the modem's NRST signal.

        This signal is open-drain, active-low as interpreted by the
        modem.

    busy-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: |
        GPIO connected to the modem's BUSY signal.

    antenna-enable-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        Antenna power enable pin.

    tx-enable-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        Antenna switch TX enable GPIO. If set, the driver tracks the
        state of the radio and controls the RF switch.

    rx-enable-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        Antenna switch RX enable GPIO. If set, the driver tracks the
        state of the radio and controls the RF switch.

    dio1-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: |
        GPIO connected to DIO1. This GPIO will be used as a generic
        IRQ line from the chip.

    dio2-tx-enable:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: |
        Use DIO2 to drive an RF switch selecting between the TX and RX
        paths. When enabled, DIO2 goes high when the chip is
        transmitting.

    dio3-tcxo-voltage:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        TCXO supply voltage controlled by DIO3 if present.

        See constants in dt-bindings/lora/sx126x.h.

    tcxo-power-startup-delay-ms:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        Startup delay to let the TCXO stabilize after TCXO power on.
