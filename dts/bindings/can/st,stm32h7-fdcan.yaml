      Divides the kernel clock giving the time quanta clock that is fed to the FDCAN core
      (FDCAN_CCU->CCFG CDIV register bits). Note that the divisor is common to all
      'st,stm32h7-fdcan' instances.

      Divide by 1 is the peripherals reset value and remains set unless this property is configured.
