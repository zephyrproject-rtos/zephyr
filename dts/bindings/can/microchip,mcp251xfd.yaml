  Microchip MCP251XFD SPI CAN FD controller

  The MCP251XFD node is defined on an SPI bus. An example
  configuration is:

  &mikrobus_spi {
      cs-gpios = <&mikrobus_header 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

      mcp2518fd_mikroe_mcp2518fd_click: mcp2518fd@0 {
          compatible = "microchip,mcp251xfd";
          status = "okay";

          spi-max-frequency = <18000000>;
          int-gpios = <&mikrobus_header 7 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
          reg = <0x0>;
          osc-freq = <40000000>;

          bus-speed = <125000>;
          bus-speed-data = <1000000>;
      };
  };

compatible: "microchip,mcp251xfd"

include: [spi-device.yaml, can-fd-controller.yaml]

properties:
  osc-freq:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Frequency of the external oscillator in Hz.

  int-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      The interrupt signal from the controller is active low in push-pull mode.
      The property value should ensure the flags properly describe the signal
      that is presented to the driver.

  pll-enable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enables controller PLL, which multiplies input clock frequency by 10.
      This parameter also implicitly sets whether the clock is from the PLL
      output or directly from the oscillator.
      If this option is enabled the clock source is the PLL, otherwise its
      the oscillator.

  timestamp-prescaler:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      Prescaler value for computing the timestamps of received messages.
      The timestamp counter is derived from the internal clock divided by this value.
      Valid range is [1, 1024].

  sof-on-clko:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Output start-of-frame (SOF) signal on the CLKO pin every time
      a Start bit of a CAN message is transmitted or received. If this option
      is not set, then an internal clock (typically 40MHz or 20MHz) will be
      output on CLKO pin instead.

  clko-div:
    type: int
    description: The factor to divide the system clock for CLKO pin.
    default: 10
    enum:
      - 1
      - 2
      - 4
      - 10
