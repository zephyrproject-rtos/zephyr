      Required if the "clk-source" property is present.

  clk-source:

    enum:
      - 0
      - 1
    description: |
      CAN engine clock source. The value of this property, if present, selects the corresponding
      named clock from the "clocks" property. A value of "0" selects "clksrc0" whereas a value of
      "1" selects "clksrc1".

      The value of this property is written to the CLKSRC bit of the FlexCAN CTRL1 register for
      controlling the 1-bit, internal clock multiplexer.

      Omit this property for FlexCAN instances that do not have a 1-bit, internal multiplexer
      (FlexCAN CTRL1 register bit 13 is marked as "reserved").

  number-of-mb:
    type: int
    required: true
