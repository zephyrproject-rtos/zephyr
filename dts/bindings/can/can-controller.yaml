properties:
  bus-speed:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: bus speed in Baud/s
  sjw:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Resynchronization jump width (ISO 11898-1)
  prop-seg:
    type: int
    description: Time quantums of propagation segment (ISO 11898-1)

    description: Time quantums of phase buffer 2 segment (ISO 11898-1)
  sample-point:
    type: int
    description: >
      Sample point in permille.
      This param is required if segments are not given.
      If the sample point is given, the segments are ignored.
  phys:
    type: phandle
    description: |
      Actively controlled CAN transceiver.

      Example:
        transceiver0: can-phy0 {
          compatible = "nxp,tja1040", "can-transceiver-gpio";
          standby-gpios = <gpioa 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
          max-bitrate = <1000000>;
          #phy-cells = <0>;
        };

        &can0 {
          status = "okay";

          phys = <&transceiver0>;
        };

child-binding:
  description: |
    Passive CAN transceiver. The child node must be named "can-transceiver".

    Example:
      &can0 {
        status = "okay";

        can-transceiver {
          max-bitrate = <1000000>;
        };
      };

  properties:
    max-bitrate:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        The maximum bitrate supported by the CAN transceiver in bits/s.
