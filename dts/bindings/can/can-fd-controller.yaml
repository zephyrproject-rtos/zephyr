# Common fields for CAN FD controllers

include: can-controller.yaml

properties:
  bus-speed-data:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Initial data phase bitrate in bit/s.
  sample-point-data:
    type: int
    description: |
      Initial data phase sample point in per mille (e.g. 875 equals 87.5%).

      If this is unset (or if it is set to 0), the initial sample point will default to 75.0% for
      bitrates over 800 kbit/s, 80.0% for bitrates over 500 kbit/s, and 87.5% for all other
      bitrates.
  tx-delay-comp-offset:
    type: int
    default: 0
