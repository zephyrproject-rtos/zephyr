      PORT pin configuration for TX, RX signals.
      We expect that the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes. These
      nodes will have a nodelabel that matches the Infineon SoC Pinctrl
      defines and be of the form p<port>_<pin><peripheral inst>_<signal>.

      Examples
        pinctrl-0 = <&p5_3_canfd0_ttcan_tx1 &p5_2_canfd0_ttcan_rx1>;
