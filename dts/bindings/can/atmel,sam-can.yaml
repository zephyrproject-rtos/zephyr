    description: Clock divider for the CAN core clock
      This property is required for samx7x SOCs. It is recommended to use the
      CAN clock at frequencies of 20, 40 or 80 MHz. To achieve these frequencies,
      PMC PCK5 must select the UPLLCK (480 MHz) as source clock and divide by 24,
      12, or 6. PCK5 allows the system bus and processor clock to be modified
      without affecting the bit rate communication.
