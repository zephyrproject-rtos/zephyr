  Xilinx Processor System CAN controller
  This CAN controller is contained in both the Xilinx Zynq-7000 and
  ZynqMP (UltraScale) SoCs.
compatible: "xlnx,zynq-can-1.0"

include: can-controller.yaml

  clock-frequency:
    type: int
    description: |
      This property must only be specified if clock control facilities
      are unavailable on the current target - at the time being, this
      applies to targets based on the ZynqMP/UltraScale SoCs.
      Specifies the base clock frequency from which the CAN controller's
      clock frequency for the selected baud rate will be derived using a
      divider in the respective CAN controller's Baud Rate Prescaler
      Register. Therefore, the value of this item must be set to the clock
      frequency of the PLL supplying the respective CAN controller's clock
      - by default, this is the IO PLL.
