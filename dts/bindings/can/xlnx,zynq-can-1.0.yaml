  Xilinx Processor System CAN controller

  This CAN controller is contained in both the Xilinx Zynq-7000 and
  ZynqMP (UltraScale) SoCs.

compatible: "xlnx,zynq-can-1.0"

include: can-controller.yaml

properties:
    reg:
      required: true

    interrupts:
      required: true

    clock-frequency:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        Specifies the base clock frequency from which the CAN controller's
        clock frequency for the selected baud rate will be derived using a
        divider in the respective CAN controller's Baud Rate Prescaler
        Register. Therefore, the value of this item must be set to the clock
        frequency of the PLL supplying the respective CAN controller's clock
        - by default, this is the IO PLL.
