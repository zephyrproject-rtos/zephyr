      Divides the kernel clock giving the time quanta clock that is fed to the
      CAN core(FDCAN_CKDIV).
      Note that the divisor is common to all 'st,stm32-fdcan' instances.
      Divide by 1 is the peripherals reset value and remains set unless
      this property is configured.

  external-timestamp-counter:
    type: phandle
    description: |
      Phandle to the counter device to be used as the external RX timestamp source.

      When this property is defined, the driver configures the FDCAN Timestamp
      Counter Configuration (TSCC) to use the External Timestamp (TSS=0x2).

      Hardware Constraint: The selected timer must be physically routed to the
      fdcan_ts input in the SoC interconnect. (e.g. TIM3 on STM32G4). The exact timer
      connected to the fdcan_ts input can be found in the reference manual of the specific SoC.
