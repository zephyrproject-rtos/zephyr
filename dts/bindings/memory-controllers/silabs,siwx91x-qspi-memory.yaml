  Silicon Labs QSPI (Quad Serial Protocol Interface) memory controller.

  This driver expects a children node compatible with "zephyr,memory-region".
  The size of the PSRAM is taken from this node. It also used by Zephyr to
  declare the area in the linker script.

  Note after the chip reset, the bootloader may automatically configure the
  Memory Controller. So, the user may be able to properly use the PSRAM without
  this driver (in this case, only the "zephyr,memory-region" node is required).

  This driver allows for non default configurations. In this case, if the users
  want to take advantage of the automatic data relocation of Zephyr, they have
  to tune the MEMC_INIT_PRIORITY value to initialize this driver before the
  initialization of the kernel resources. Then, they will probably want to also
  initialize the clock driver before this driver.

  Otherwise, it is also possible to start this driver later in the boot
  sequence, but the user will have to manage the memory region manually.

      Value returned by the chip on READ_ID command. An array of 8 bytes is
      expected. However only the two first bytes (should be "Manufacturer ID"
      and "Known Good Die") are used. The driver won't continue if the value
      returned by the chip does not match this field.
