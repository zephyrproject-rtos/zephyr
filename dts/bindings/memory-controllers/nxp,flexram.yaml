  NXP FlexRAM on-chip ram controller
  If the flexram,bank-spec property is specified, then the flexram will be
  dynamically reconfigured to the configuration specified at runtime. An
  example to configure the flexram dynamically using the
  flexram,bank-spec property for rt1060 is as follows:

  &itcm {
          reg = < 0x0 DT_SIZE_K(64) >;
  };
  &dtcm {
          reg = < 0x20000000 DT_SIZE_K(384) >;
  };
  &ocram {
          reg = < 0x20280000 DT_SIZE_K(64) >;
  };
  &flexram {
          flexram,bank-spec = <FLEXRAM_OCRAM>,
                              <FLEXRAM_OCRAM>,
                              <FLEXRAM_DTCM>,
                              <FLEXRAM_DTCM>,
                              <FLEXRAM_DTCM>,
                              <FLEXRAM_DTCM>,
                              <FLEXRAM_DTCM>,
                              <FLEXRAM_DTCM>,
                              <FLEXRAM_ITCM>,
                              <FLEXRAM_ITCM>,
                              <FLEXRAM_DTCM>,
                              <FLEXRAM_DTCM>,
                              <FLEXRAM_DTCM>,
                              <FLEXRAM_DTCM>,
                              <FLEXRAM_DTCM>,
                              <FLEXRAM_DTCM>;
  };

  This will configure the flexram for 384K of DTCM, 64K of ITCM,
  and 64K of OCRAM.
