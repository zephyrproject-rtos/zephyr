  STM32 Battery Backed RAM

  STM32 BBRAM are 32-bit registers which can be used for storing user
  application data. They are implemented in the backup domain that remains
  powered-on by VBAT when the VDD power is switched off. They are not reset
  by system reset or when the device wakes up from Standby mode. They are
  reset by a backup domain reset.

  Note: Since STM32 BBRAM is in RTC backup domain, STM32 RTC node must be
        enabled if STM32 BBRAM node is enabled.
