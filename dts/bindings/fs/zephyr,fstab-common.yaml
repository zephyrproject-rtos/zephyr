properties:
  mount-point:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: |
      The absolute path used as the file system mount point.

  automount:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Mount file system on boot if present.

      During initialization the file system driver will attempt to mount
      this partition.

  read-only:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Mount file system read-only if present.

      This adds the FS_MOUNT_FLAG_READ_ONLY option to be set in the
      mount descriptor generated for the file system.

  no-format:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Do not format file system if mount fails.

      This causes the FS_MOUNT_FLAG_NO_FORMAT option to be set in the
      mount descriptor generated for the file system.

  disk-access:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Use disk-access for accessing storage media.

      This causes the FS_MOUNT_FLAG_USE_DISK_ACCESS option to be set in
      the mount descriptor generated for the file system.
