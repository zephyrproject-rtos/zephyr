    description:  |
      List of configuration pairs representing a CPU usage threshold and
      corresponding CPU frequency in Hz. Each configuration pair consists of
      [threshold, frequency].
      For example
        cfgdata = <75 1000000000>, <50 800000000>, <25 300000000>;
      This means
        - If threshold is 75% or higher, set frequency to 1 GHz
        - If threshold is 50% or higher, set frequency to 800 MHz
        - If threshold is 25% or higher, set frequency to 300 MHz
