include: [base.yaml, pinctrl-device.yaml]

properties:
  channel:
    type: int
    description: channel MTU

  reg:
    required: true

  reg-names:
    required: true

  clocks:
    required: true

  counter-clear-channel:
    type: int
    description:
      Choose one channel to act as counter clear channel. Not required in synchronous
      mode if another synchronous MTU has a counter clear channel defined. If neither a channel
      nor synchronous mode is chosen, it is not possible to set a period, but the MTU will use a
      constant period of 0xffff cycles.

  synchronous:
    type: boolean
    description:
      if set, the device will operate in synchronous mode. All MTU devices in
      synchronous mode have the same period (in cycles, but subject to different prescaler
      settings). Only one of the synchronous devices has to specify a counter clear channel.

  bit-idx:
    type: int
    required: true
    description:
      which bit of the common timer start register (TSTR) and timer synchronous
      register (TSYR) to set for this device.
