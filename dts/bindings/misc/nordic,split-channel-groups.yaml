description: Nordic Split Channel Groups

properties:
  owned-channel-groups:
    type: array
    description: |
      List of channel groups of a split-ownership peripheral that are to be
      owned for use by the compiled domain.

  nonsecure-channel-groups:
    type: array
    description: |
      List of channel groups in a split-ownership, split-security peripheral
      that are to be configured as nonsecure. In Trustzone systems, this
      property is only evaluated for secure peripherals, as nonsecure channels
      are implicitly specified through the owned-channels property. This
      property is ignored in non-Trustzone systems.
