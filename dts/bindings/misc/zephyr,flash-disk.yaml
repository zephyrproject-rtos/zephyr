description: Block storage device on flash partition

compatible: "zephyr,flash-disk"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  partition:
    type: phandle
    required: true
    description: |
      Backing storage flash map partition.

  disk-name:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: |
      Disk name.

  sector-size:
    type: int
    default: 512
    description: |
      Emulated block device sector size in bytes.

  cache-size:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Size of statically allocated buffer size in bytes. The size should be
      adequately chosen. On storage backends with uniform erase-blocks it
      should be at least the erase-block-size, on storage backends with
      non-uniform erase-blocks it should be at least the largest
      erase-block-size. The cache-size property is ignored if the partition
      is read-only.
