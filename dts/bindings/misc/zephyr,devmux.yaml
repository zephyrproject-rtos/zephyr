properties:

  devices:
    type: phandles
    required: true
    description: |
      Devices to be multiplexed.

  selected:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Initial multiplexer selection.

      This must be in the range [0, N-1], where N is the length of the
      'devices' phandle list.

      If unspecified, the default selection is zero in order to ensure that
      the multiplexer is ready for use (i.e. one of the [0, N-1] multiplexed
      devices is selected). Zero is, necessarily, the only possible valid
      default value since the phandle list must have length >= 1.

      Note: Specifying a value of 'selected' outside the range [0, N-1]
      results in a compile-time error.
