title: GPIO pin definitions for tests

description: >
    Identify accessible board pins that can be used for GPIO signals.

    Most development boards expose several GPIO pins on a header.  These
    may be used as signals to a logic analyzer, or to simulate an
    external device.  This binding provides a board-independent
    description of pins that can be made available for this purpose.

          Accessible pins used for GPIO-based instrumentation and
          testing.

          Any number of pins may be provided, on multiple GPIO devices.
          However at least two entries must be present, and the first
          two must be on the same GPIO device.
