  I2C EEPROMs compatible with Atmel's AT24 family

  There are multiple vendors manufacturing I2C EEPROMs compatible with the programming model of the
  Atmel AT24.

  Examples of compatible EEPROM families:
  - Microchip AT24xxx
  - ST M24xxx

  Each of these can be represented by a set of common parameters (EEPROM size, page size, address
  width, and timeout) available from the datasheet of the specific EEPROM. The compatible string for
  these can list the specific EEPROM vendor and model along with the vendor EEPROM family as long as
  the least-specific compatible entry is "atmel,at24".

  Example devicetree node describing a ST M24M01 EEPROM on the i2c0 bus:

    &i2c0 {
      status = "okay";
      clock-frequency = <I2C_BITRATE_FAST>;

      eeprom@56 {
        compatible = "st,m24m01", "st,m24xxx", "atmel,at24";
        reg = <0x56>;
        size = <DT_SIZE_K(128)>;
        pagesize = <256>;
        address-width = <16>;
        timeout = <5>;
     };
   };

compatible: "atmel,at24"
