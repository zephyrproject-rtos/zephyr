  AT25XV021A SPI flash variants

  Example datasheet: https://www.renesas.com/en/document/dst/at25xv021a-datasheet

  The AT25XV021A variants add sector protect and unprotect features, which
  requires additional steps to program or erase data from the device when compared
  to other devices in the AT25 family.
