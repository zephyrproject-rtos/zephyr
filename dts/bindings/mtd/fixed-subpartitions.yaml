  Fixed subpartitions of a flash (or other nonvolatile storage) memory.

  Here is an example:

    &flash0 {
            partitions {
                    compatible = "fixed-partitions";
                    #address-cells = <1>;
                    #size-cells = <1>;

                    slot0_partition: partition@10000 {
                            compatible = "fixed-subpartitions";
                            label = "image-0";
                            reg = <0x00010000 0x70000>;
                            ranges = <0x0 0x10000 0x70000>;
                            #address-cells = <1>;
                            #size-cells = <1>;

                            slot0_s_partition: partition@0 {
                                    label = "image-0-secure";
                                    reg = <0x00000000 0x40000>;
                            };

                            slot0_ns_partition: partition@40000 {
                                    label = "image-0-nonsecure";
                                    reg = <0x00040000 0x30000>;
                            };
                    };
            };
    };

compatible: "fixed-subpartitions"

properties:
  label:
    type: string
    description: |
      Human readable string describing the flash partition.
  read-only:
    type: boolean
    description: set this property if the partition is read-only
  reg:
    type: array
    description: |
      This should be in the format <OFFSET SIZE>, where OFFSET
      is the offset of the flash partition relative to the base
      address of the parent memory, and SIZE is the size of
      the partition in bytes.
    required: true
  "#address-cells":
    type: int
    description: |
      Number of cells required to represent a child node's
      reg property address. This must be large enough to
      represent the start offset of each partition.
  "#size-cells":
    type: int
    description: |
      Number of cells required to represent a child node's
      reg property address. This must be large enough to
      represent the size of each partition in bytes.

child-binding:
  description: |
    Each child node of the fixed-partitions node represents
    an individual flash partition. These should usually
    look like this:

      partition_nodelabel: partition@START_OFFSET {
              label = "human-readable-name";
              reg = <0xSTART_OFFSET 0xSIZE>;
      };
  properties:
    label:

    read-only:
      type: boolean
      description: set this property if the partition is read-only
    reg:
      type: array
      description: |
        This should be in the format <OFFSET SIZE>, where OFFSET
        is the offset of the flash partition relative to the base
        address of the parent memory, and SIZE is the size of
