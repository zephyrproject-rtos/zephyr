      The flash controller is limited by hardware to erase whole blocks of flash
      at a time. This property describes the layout of the erase-blocks, which can
      vary in size within the flash memory area.

      Currently, Renesas SoCs use different versions of code-flash. While most code-flash
      defines `erase-block-size` as one block, some versions have blocks with different sizes
      and divided into regions. Therefore, this property reflects the actual `erase-block-size`
      for each region of code-flash, depending on the flash version.

      For example:
        - The R7FA8M1AHECBD's code-flash has `flash-hardware-version = <40>` and uses
        the following blocks layout:
          |--------------------|
          | 8 Kbytes           |
          |--------------------|  number of 8kb blocks = 8
          | 8 Kbytes           |
          |--------------------|
          | 32 Kbytes          |
          |--------------------|
          | 32 Kbytes          |  number of 32kb blocks = 61
          |--------------------|
          | 32 Kbytes          |
          |--------------------|
        The "erase-block" should has the value like this:
          erase-blocks = <&flash 8 8192>, <&flash 61 32768>;

        - The R7FA4L1BD4CFP's code-flash has `flash-hardware-version = <4>` and uses
        the following blocks layout:
          |--------------------|
          | 2 Kbytes           |
          |--------------------|
          | 2 Kbytes           |  number of 2kb blocks = 256
          |--------------------|
          | 2 Kbytes           |
          |--------------------|
        The "erase-block" should has the value like this:
          erase-blocks = <&flash 256 2048>;
