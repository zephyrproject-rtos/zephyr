    description: |
      Specify the number of data lines and opcode used for writing.
      If not provided pp will be selected.

  address-size-32:
    type: boolean
    required: false
    description: |
      Set to indicate that 32-bit addressing is to be used.
      If not specified 24-bit addressing will be used.

  ppsize-512:
    type: boolean
    required: false
    description: |
      Set to indicate that the write opcode operates on 512-byte pages.
      If not specified the write opcode operates on 256-byte pages.

    required: false
    default: 0
    description: |
      Number of clock cycles CSn must be asserted before it can go low
      again, specified in nanoseconds.

  cpha:
    type: boolean
    required: false
    description: |
      Set to indicate phase starts with asserted half-phase (CPHA=1).
      For this driver using this property requires also using cpol.

  cpol:
    type: boolean
    required: false
    description: |
      Set to indicate clock leading edge is falling (CPOL=1).
      For this driver using this property requires also using cpha.

  sck-frequency:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Maximum clock speed supported by the device, in Hz.
