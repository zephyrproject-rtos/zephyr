  QSPI hyperflash connected to the NXP S32 QSPI bus.

compatible: "nxp,s32-qspi-hyperflash"

include: "nxp,s32-qspi-device.yaml"

properties:
  device-id-word-addr:
    required: true
    type: int
    description: |
      The word address of the device ID in ASO (Application-Specific Object).
      This address specifies the exact location within the memory where the device ID is stored.

  rwds-low-dual-error:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable Read-Write Data Strobe (RWDS) dual error detect.

  secure-region-locked:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      The secure region is locked and cannot be accessed or modified.
      This is particularly useful in scenarios where sensitive data needs protection from
      unauthorized access, such as in financial applications or secure communication systems.
      If it is disable, having access to all memory regions is beneficial during development
      or debugging phases.

  vcc-mv:
    type: int
    required: true
    enum:
      - 1800
      - 3000

      - 45
      - 68
      - 71
      - 117
    description: |
      Specifies the output drive strength in ohm, which based on the operating device VCC.
      The supported typical impedance settings:
        For 1.8V: 117 Ohm, 68 Ohm, 45 Ohm, 34 Ohm, 27 Ohm, 24 Ohm, 20 Ohm
        For 3V: 71 Ohm, 40 Ohm, 27 Ohm, 20 Ohm, 16 Ohm, 14 Ohm, 12 Ohm
      See the xVCR[14:12] field in VCR configuration register in the memory device datasheet.

      - 15
      - 16
    description: |
      Specifies the read latency in cycles, which is determined based on the operating frequency
      as specified in the memory device datasheet.

  support-only-uniform-sectors:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      The memory device supports only uniform (256KB) sectors.
