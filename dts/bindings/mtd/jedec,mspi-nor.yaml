properties:
  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      RESET line. If specified, the flash chip will be reset at initialization.

  t-reset-pulse:
    type: int
    description: |
      Minimum duration, in nanoseconds, of an active pulse on the RESET line.

  t-reset-recovery:
    type: int
    description: |
      Minimum time, in nanoseconds, the flash chip needs to recover after reset.
      Such delay is performed when a GPIO or software reset is done, or after
      power is supplied to the chip if the "supply-gpios" property is specified.

  transfer-timeout:
    type: int
    default: 10
    description: |
      Maximum time, in milliseconds, allowed for a single transfer on the MSPI
      bus in communication with the flash chip. The default value is the one
      that was previously hard-coded in the flash_mspi_nor driver.

  use-4byte-addressing:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Indicates that 4-byte addressing is to be used in communication with
      the flash chip. The driver will use dedicated 4-byte address instruction
      codes for commands that require addresses (like Read, Page Program,
      or Erase) if those are supported by the flash chip, or if necessary,
      it will switch the chip to 4-byte addressing mode.

  initial-soft-reset:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      When set, the flash driver performs software reset of the flash chip
      at initialization.
