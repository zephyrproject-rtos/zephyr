description: Generic NOR flash on MSPI bus

compatible: "jedec,mspi-nor"

include: [mspi-device.yaml, "jedec,spi-nor-common.yaml"]

properties:
  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      RESET line. If specified, the flash chip will be reset at initialization.

  t-reset-pulse:
    type: int
    description: |
      Minimum duration, in nanoseconds, of an active pulse on the RESET line.

  t-reset-recovery:
    type: int
    description: |
      Minimum time, in nanoseconds, the flash chip needs to recover after reset.

  transfer-timeout:
    type: int
    default: 10
    description: |
      Maximum time, in milliseconds, allowed for a single transfer on the MSPI
      bus in communication with the flash chip. The default value is the one
      that was previously hard-coded in the flash_mspi_nor driver.
