      description: |
        Chip select interval units, in serial clock cycles. See the
        CSINTERVALUNIT field in registers FLASHA1CR0 through FLASHB2CR0. The
        default corresponds to the reset value of the register field.

    cs-interval:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 0
      description: |
        Minimum interval between chip select deassertion and assertion. See the
        CSINTERVAL field in registers FLASHA1CR0 through FLASHB2CR0. The
        default corresponds to the reset value of the register field.

    cs-setup-time:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 3
      description: |
        Chip select setup time, in serial clock cycles. See the TCSS field in
        registers FLASHA1CR0 through FLASHB2CR0. The default corresponds to the
        reset value of the register field.

    cs-hold-time:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 3
      description: |
        Chip select hold time, in serial clock cycles. See the TCSH field in
        registers FLASHA1CR0 through FLASHB2CR0. The default corresponds to the
        reset value of the register field.

    data-valid-time:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 0
      description: |
        Data valid time, in nanoseconds. See the registers DLLACR through
        DLLBCR.

    column-space:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 0
      description: |
        Column address bit width. Set to zero if the flash does not support
        column address. See the CAS field in registers FLASHA1CR0 through
        FLASHB2CR0. The default corresponds to the reset value of the register
        field.

    word-addressable:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: |
        Don't transmit the least significant address bit when the flash is word
        addressable. See the WA field in registers FLASHA1CR0 through
        FLASHB2CR0.

        field in registers FLASHA1CR2 through FLASHB2CR2. The default
        corresponds to the reset value of the register field.

    ahb-write-wait-interval:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 0
      description: |
        Time to wait between AHB triggered command sequences. See the AWRWAIT
        field in registers FLASHA1CR2 through FLASHB2CR2. The default
        corresponds to the reset value of the register field.
