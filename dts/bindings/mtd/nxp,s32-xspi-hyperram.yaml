  XSPI hyperram connected to the NXP S32 XSPI bus.

compatible: "nxp,s32-xspi-hyperram"

include: "nxp,s32-xspi-device.yaml"

properties:
  device-id-word-addr:
    required: true
    type: int
    description: |
      The word address of the device ID in ASO (Application-Specific Object).
      This address specifies the exact location within the memory where the device ID is stored.

  master-clock-type:
    type: string
    enum:
      - "SINGLE_ENDED"
      - "DIFFERENTIAL"
    description: |
      Selects the clock types:
        - Differential Clock: Command, address, and data information is output with respect
          to the crossing of the CK and CK# signals. Differential clock is used on 1.8V I/O devices.
        - Single Ended Clock: CK# is not used on 3.0V devices, only a single ended CK is used.
          The clock is not required to be free-running.

  drive-strength-ohm:
    type: int
    required: true
    enum: [19, 22, 27, 34, 46, 67, 115]
    default: 34
    description: |
      Specifies the output drive strength in ohm, which based on the operating device VCC.
      The supported typical impedance settings:
        19 ohm, 22 ohm, 27 ohm, 34 ohm, 46 ohm, 67 ohm, 115 ohm
      See the CR0[14:12] field in CR0 configuration register in the memory device datasheet.
      Defaults to reset value.

  refresh-interval-multiplier:
    type: string
    enum:
      - "1"
      - "1.5"
      - "2"
      - "4"
    default: "1"
    description: |
      Automatic memory refresh interval multiplier. Controls how frequently memory is refreshed.
      Defaults to reset value.

  initial-latency-cycles:
    type: int
    required: true
    enum: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
    description: |
      Specifies the read latency in cycles, which is determined based on the operating frequency
      as specified in the memory device datasheet.
