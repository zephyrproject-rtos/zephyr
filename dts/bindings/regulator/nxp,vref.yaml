  nxp,buffer-startup-delay-us:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Buffer startup delay as specified in the
      appropriate device data sheet, in microseconds.

  nxp,bandgap-startup-time-us:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Maximum bandgap startup time as specified in the
      appropriate device data sheet, in microseconds.

  nxp,current-compensation-en:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable second-order curvature compensation.
      This must be enabled to achieve the performance stated in the datasheet.
      However, the reset value of the peripheral has it disabled.

  nxp,internal-voltage-regulator-en:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enables the internal regulator to produce a constant internal voltage
      supply to reduce the sensitivity to external supply noise and variation.

  nxp,chop-oscillator-en:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enables the chop oscillator. When set, the internal chopping operation
      is enabled and the internal analog offset is minimized. When using the
      internal voltage regulator, you must also enable the chop oscillator.
