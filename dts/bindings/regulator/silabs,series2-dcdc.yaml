  Silicon Labs Series 2 DC-DC converter.

  Include the bindings header file <zephyr/dt-bindings/regulator/silabs_dcdc.h> to get
  access to relevant symbols for configuration.

  The following standard properties are supported:

  `regulator-boot-on`
    Enable DC-DC converter at boot. If not set, the DC-DC converter is powered off.
  `regulator-allow-bypass`
    Enable bypass mode. If combined with `regulator-boot-on`, the DC-DC converter
    is initialized to bypass mode.
  `regulator-initial-mode`
    DCDC operating mode. One of `SILABS_DCDC_MODE_BUCK` or `SILABS_DCDC_MODE_BOOST`.
  `regulator-init-microvolt`
    Output voltage for boost mode. Not used in buck mode.
