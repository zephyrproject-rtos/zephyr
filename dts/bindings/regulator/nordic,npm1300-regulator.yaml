  Nordic nPM1300 PMIC

  The PMIC has two buck converters and two LDOs.
  The regulators need to be defined as child nodes, strictly following the
  BUCK1,2 LDO1..2, node names. For
  example:

  pmic@6b {
    reg = <0x6b>;
    ...
    regulators {
      compatible = "nordic,npm1300-regulator";

      BUCK1 {
        /* all properties for BUCK1 */
      };
      BUCK2 {
        /* all properties for BUCK2 */
      };
      LDO1 {
        /* all properties for LDO1 */
      };
      LDO2 {
        /* all properties for LDO2 */
      };
    };
  };

compatible: "nordic,npm1300-regulator"

      Set_dvs_mode will drive these pins as follows:
        DVS mode 1 will enable the first pin
        DVS mode 2 will enable the second pin
        DVS mode 3 will drive the first and second pins
        etc.
      The effect of the mode change is defined by the enable-gpios
      and pwm_gpios fields for each of the regulator blocks.

        Disable the SW workaround for nPM1300 anomaly #38.
        When nPM1300 is in ULP mode, LDO is supplied from VSYS and
        then LDO is enabled, it can take long time until the LDO
        output has reached its target voltage. To avoid this, an i2c
        read is performed shortly after an LDO is enabled.
        See nPM1300 Errata manual for more details.
