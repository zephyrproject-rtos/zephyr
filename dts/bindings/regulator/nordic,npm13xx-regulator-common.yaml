      List of SOC GPIOs connected to PMIC GPIOs.
      Set_dvs_mode will drive these pins as follows:
        DVS mode 1 will enable the first pin
        DVS mode 2 will enable the second pin
        DVS mode 3 will drive the first and second pins
        etc.
      The effect of the mode change is defined by the enable-gpios
      and pwm_gpios fields for each of the regulator blocks.

      type: boolean
      description: |
        Enable active-discharge on the BUCK/LDO/LDSW output when disabled.

    nordic,anomaly38-disable-workaround:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Disable the SW workaround for nPM13xx anomaly #38.
        When nPM13xx is in ULP mode, LDO is supplied from VSYS and
        then LDO is enabled, it can take long time until the LDO
        output has reached its target voltage. To avoid this, an i2c
        read is performed shortly after an LDO is enabled.
        See nPM13xx Errata manual for more details.
