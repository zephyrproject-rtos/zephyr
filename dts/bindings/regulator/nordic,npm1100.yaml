  Nordic nPM1100 PMIC

  The PMIC has one buck converter. It needs to be defined as a child node,
  strictly following the BUCK node name. For example:

  pmic {
    compatible = "nordic,npm1100";

    BUCK {
      /* all properties for BUCK */
    };
  };

  Note that only mode can be controlled (via GPIO pin MODE).

compatible: "nordic,npm1100"
