    Description for a voltage divider, with optional ability to measure
    resistance of the upper leg.

compatible: "voltage-divider"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  io-channels:
    required: true
    description: |
      Channels available with this divider configuration.

  output-ohms:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Resistance of the lower leg of the voltage divider

  full-ohms:
    type: int
    description: |
      Resistance of the full path through the voltage divider.

      If absent or zero the driver assumes that the upper leg is a
      resistance-based sensor.

  power-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Control power to the voltage divider inputs.

      If present the corresponding GPIO must be set to an active level
      to enable the divider input.
