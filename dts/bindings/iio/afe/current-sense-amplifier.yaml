  When an io-channel measures the voltage over a current sense amplifier,
  the interesting measurement is almost always the current through the
  sense resistor, not the voltage over it. This binding describes such a current
  sense circuit.

  This is based on Linux, documentation:
    https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iio/afe/current-sense-amplifier.yaml

compatible: "current-sense-amplifier"

      If present the corresponding GPIO must be set to an active level
      to enable the current amplifier.
