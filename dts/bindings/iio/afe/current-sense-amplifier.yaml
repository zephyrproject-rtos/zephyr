  When an io-channel measures the voltage over a current sense amplifier,
  the interesting measurement is almost always the current through the
  sense resistor, not the voltage over it. This binding describes such a current
  sense circuit.

  This is based on Linux, documentation:
    https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iio/afe/current-sense-amplifier.yaml

compatible: "current-sense-amplifier"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  io-channels:
    required: true
    description: |
      Channels available with this divider configuration.

  sense-resistor-milli-ohms:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Resistance of the shunt resistor in milli-ohms.

  sense-gain-mult:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      Amplifier gain multiplier. The default is <1>. The maximum value is <65535>.

  sense-gain-div:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      Amplifier gain divider. The default is <1>. The maximum value is <65535>.

  power-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Control power to the current amplifier.

      If present the corresponding GPIO must be set to an active level
      to enable the current amplifier.

  enable-calibration:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable calibration of the current sense amplifier.
      This is used to calibrate the ADC prior to taking measurements.

  zephyr,noise-threshold:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
     Raw ADC readings below this threshold are treated as noise and
     reported as 0 uA. The default value of 0 disables the threshold.
