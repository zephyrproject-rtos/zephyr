  When an io-channel measures the voltage over a current sense shunt,
  the interesting measurement is almost always the current through the
  shunt, not the voltage over it. This binding describes such a current
  sense circuit.

  This is based on Linux, documentation:
    https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iio/afe/current-sense-shunt.yaml
