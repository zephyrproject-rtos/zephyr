  This file needs to be included by devices that need to specify clock
  controller states. The maximum number of states currently defined is 5
  (clock-state-0...clock-state-4) but can be incremented if required.
  Clock state nodes are used to configure a clock controller, by setting
  properties on clock nodes declared as children of the clock controller.
  Clock states may represent a full clock tree, but there is no requirement
  for them to.

      Clock configuration/s for the first state. Content should be a series of
      references to the clock nodes declared as children of the clock
      controller. The specifier cells to these clock nodes are specific to the
      implementation of the system's clock controller

      Clock configuration/s for the second state. See clock-state-0.

      Clock configuration/s for the third state. See clock-state-0.

      Clock configuration/s for the fourth state. See clock-state-0.

      Clock configuration/s for the fifth state. See clock-state-0.

      Names for the provided states. The number of names needs to match the
      number of states.
