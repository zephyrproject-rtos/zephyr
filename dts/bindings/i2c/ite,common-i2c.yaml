      The default setting is as described below
      0 = I2C_CHA_LOCATE: Channel A is located at SMCLK0/SMDAT0
      1 = I2C_CHB_LOCATE: Channel B is located at SMCLK1/SMDAT1
      2 = I2C_CHC_LOCATE: Channel C is located at SMCLK2/SMDAT2
      3 = I2C_CHD_LOCATE: Channel D is located at SMCLK3/SMDAT3
      4 = I2C_CHE_LOCATE: Channel E is located at SMCLK4/SMDAT4
      5 = I2C_CHF_LOCATE: Channel F is located at SMCLK5/SMDAT5

      The following is an example of the 'channel-switch-sel' property
      being swapped between node &i2c0 and &i2c2 in the application:
      Note: The property of 'port-num' cannot be changed in the
            application.

      Channel C is located at SMCLK0/SMDAT0:
      &i2c0 {
             channel-switch-sel = <I2C_CHC_LOCATE>;
             pinctrl-0 = <&i2c2_clk_gpf6_default
                          &i2c2_data_gpf7_default>;
             pinctrl-names = "default";
             scl-gpios = <&gpiof 6 0>;
             sda-gpios = <&gpiof 7 0>;
      };

      Channel A is located at SMCLK2/SMDAT2:
      &i2c2 {
             channel-switch-sel = <I2C_CHA_LOCATE>;
             pinctrl-0 = <&i2c0_clk_gpb3_default
                          &i2c0_data_gpb4_default>;
             pinctrl-names = "default";
             scl-gpios = <&gpiob 3 0>;
             sda-gpios = <&gpiob 4 0>;
      };

      If the property of 'channel-switch-sel' is changed, the pinctrl
      setting and recovery pin in &i2c0 and &i2c2 nodes must also be
      modified accordingly.

  scl-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      The SCL pin for the selected port.

  sda-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      The SDA pin for the selected port.

  clock-gate-offset:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      The clock gate offsets combine the register offset from
      ECPM_BASE and the mask within that register into one value.

  pinctrl-0:
    required: true

  pinctrl-names:
    required: true

  push-pull-recovery:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      This property is enabled when selecting the push-pull GPIO output
      type to drive the I2C recovery. The default is open-drain.
