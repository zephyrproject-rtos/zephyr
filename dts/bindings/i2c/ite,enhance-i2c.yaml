      This option is used to configure the I2C speed prescaler for
      the SCL low period. When set to >= 1, it will increase the
      low period of the SCL clock and so reduce the signal frequency.
      The resulting SCL cycle time is given by the following formula:
      SCL cycle = 2 * (psr + prescale_tweak + 2) *
                  SMBus clock cycle
