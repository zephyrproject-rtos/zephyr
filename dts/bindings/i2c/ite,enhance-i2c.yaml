properties:
  prescale-scl-low:
    type: int
    description: |
      This option is used to configure the I2C speed prescaler for
      the SCL low period. When set to >= 1, it will increase the
      low period of the SCL clock and so reduce the signal frequency.
      The resulting SCL cycle time is given by the following formula:
      SCL cycle = 2 * (psr + prescale_tweak + 2) *
                  SMBus clock cycle

  target-enable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      This option is used when the I2C target is enabled. It is
      necessary to prevent the target port from being configured
      with I2C host related initialization.

  target-pio-mode:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      This option is used when the I2C target is enabled and it can
      support PIO mode for I2C target transfer.
