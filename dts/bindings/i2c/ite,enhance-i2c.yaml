properties:
  prescale-scl-low:
    type: int
    description: |
      This option is used to configure the I2C speed prescaler for
      the SCL low period. When set to >= 1, it will increase the
      low period of the SCL clock and so reduce the signal frequency.
      The resulting SCL cycle time is given by the following formula:
      SCL cycle = 2 * (psr + prescale_tweak + 2) *
                  SMBus clock cycle

  data-hold-time:
    type: int
    default: 3
    enum:
      - 3
      - 4
      - 5
      - 6
      - 7
      - 8
      - 9
      - 10
    description: |
      This option is used to configure the data hold time of the I2C.
      The unit is number of SMB clock cycles.  The time calculation
      is (data-hold-time / smb_clk) seconds.

  target-enable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      This option is used when the I2C target is enabled. It is
      necessary to prevent the target port from being configured
      with I2C host related initialization.

  target-pio-mode:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      This option is used when the I2C target is enabled and it can
      support PIO mode for I2C target transfer.
