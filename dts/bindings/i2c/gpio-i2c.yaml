title: I2C via GPIO bitbanging

description: |
  The GPIO pin used for SDA must be configured (through devicetree and pinmux) with suitable flags,
  i.e. as open-collector/open-drain with a pull-up resistor (pull-up can be an external component).

  The SCL pin should be configured in the same manner as the SDA pin, or, if it is known that the
  hardware attached to pin does not attempt I2C clock stretching, then the SCL pin may be configured
  as push/pull.
