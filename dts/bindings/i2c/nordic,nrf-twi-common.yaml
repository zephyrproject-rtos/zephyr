      The SDA pin to use.

      For pins P0.0 through P0.31, use the pin number. For example,
      to use P0.16 for SDA, set:

          sda-pin = <16>;

      For pins P1.0 through P1.31, add 32 to the pin number. For
      example, to use P1.2 for SDA, set:

          sda-pin = <34>;  /* 32 + 2 */

  scl-pin:
    type: int
    deprecated: true

      IMPORTANT: This option will only be used if the new pin control driver
      is not enabled.

      The SCL pin to use. The pin numbering scheme is the same as
      the sda-pin property's.
