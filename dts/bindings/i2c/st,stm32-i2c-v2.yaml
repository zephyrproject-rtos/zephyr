            An optional table of pre-computed i2c timing values with the
            matching clock configuration.

            Precise timings values for a given Hardware can be pre-computed
            with a tool like STM32CubeMX or directly from I2C_TIMINGR register
            description.

            Because timing value is valid for a given I2C peripheral clock
            frequency and target I2C bus clock, each timing value must be
            provided with the matching configuration.

            The resulting table entries should look like <periph_clock
            clock-frequency timing>

            For example timings could be defined as

                timings = <64000000 I2C_BITRATE_STANDARD 0x10707DBC>,
                          <64000000 I2C_BITRATE_FAST 0x00603D56>,
                          <56000000 I2C_BITRATE_STANDARD 0x10606DA4>,
                          <56000000 I2C_BITRATE_FAST 0x00501D63>;
