  timings:
    type: array
    description: |
        An optional table of pre-computed i2c timing values with the
        matching clock configuration.

        Precise timings values for a given Hardware can be pre-computed
        with a tool like STM32CubeMX or directly from I2C_TIMINGR register
        description.

        Because timing value is valid for a given I2C peripheral clock
        frequency and target I2C bus clock, each timing value must be
        provided with the matching configuration.

        The resulting table entries should look like <periph_clock
        clock-frequency timing>

        For example timings could be defined as

            timings = <64000000 I2C_BITRATE_STANDARD 0x10707DBC>,
                      <64000000 I2C_BITRATE_FAST 0x00603D56>,
                      <56000000 I2C_BITRATE_STANDARD 0x10606DA4>,
                      <56000000 I2C_BITRATE_FAST 0x00501D63>;

  scl-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      GPIO to which the I2C SCL signal is routed. This is only needed for
      I2C bus recovery support.

  sda-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      GPIO to which the I2C SDA signal is routed. This is only needed for
      I2C bus recovery support.

  dmas:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Optional DMA channels used by the I2C peripheral. If specified, these
      channels can be used to handle RX and TX transactions over DMA.

  dma-names:
    type: string-array
    description: |
      Names of the optional DMA channels. Expected values are "tx" for
      the TX channel and "rx" for the RX channel.
