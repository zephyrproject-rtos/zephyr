  Nordic nRF family TWIS (TWI slave with EasyDMA).

  Note: for Zephyr users, the I2C slave API is not available for
  these devices. See this issue for more details and a HAL-based
  workaround:

      https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/issues/21445

  This binding can be used for nodes which can represent TWIS
  peripherals. A single SoC peripheral ID is often associated with
  multiple I2C peripherals, like a TWIM and a TWIS. You can choose
  TWIS by setting the node's "compatible" to "nordic,nrf-twis"
  and its "status" to "okay", e.g. using an overlay file like this:

      /* This is for TWIS0 -- change to "i2c1" for TWIS1, etc. */
      &i2c0 {
              compatible = "nordic,nrf-twis";
              status = "okay";
              /* other property settings can go here */
      };

  This works on any supported SoC, for all TWIS instances.
