      XEC I2C controller has a hardware MUX to select among
      multiple I2C ports. I2C pins must be set to their I2C
      mode using PINCTRL. The driver can then select the pins
      by programming the port select register field in the
      controller's configuration register.

      I2C controller PCR register index and bit position encoded

  sda-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      I2C controller versions older than v3.8 do not make pin
      state monitoring visible in the bit-bang register without
      switching the pins from I2C control to bit-bang control.
      This can cause disruption of an open I2C session. For older
      hardware use access pin state using the GPIO driver.

      Refer to the description of sda-gpios.

  target-buf-write-req-buffer-size:
    type: int
    default: 8
    description: |
      The property allows each instance of the driver to have
      a unique target buffer write request buffer size in bytes.
      This property is only used if the driver is built with
      I2C target buffer mode enabled.
