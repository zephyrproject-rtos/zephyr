# This is a CPU functionality and not associated with any device. The Zephyr
# driver model forces us to bind this to a device tree entry in order to use it
# as entropy source. Therefore, as a workaround, we define this as a
# "zephyr,arm64-rng"-compatible device.
#
# Add a corresponding node under "cpus" in your device tree and choose this
# as "zephyr,entropy".
