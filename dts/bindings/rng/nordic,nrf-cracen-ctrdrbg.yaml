    Nordic nRF CRACEN CTR_DRBG based (Random Number Generator)

    This driver is only compatible with 54L devices, and may only be used from one processor
    core. This driver cannot be used in conjunction with the nRF security PSA solution, as both
    would attempt to use the CRACEN HW exclusively; When that is enabled, zephyr,psa-crypto-rng
    should be selected instead.

compatible: "nordic,nrf-cracen-ctrdrbg"

include: base.yaml
