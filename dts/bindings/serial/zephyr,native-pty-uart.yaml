description: Native PTY UART

compatible: "zephyr,native-pty-uart"

include: uart-controller.yaml

properties:
  on-stdinout:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Connect this PTY UART instance to the stdin & stdout of the calling shell/terminal which
      invoked the native executable. This is good enough for automated testing, or when feeding
      from a file/pipe.
      NOTE: Only one PTY UART can be connected to the stdin/out. If this property is set in several,
      it will only apply to whichever is instantiated first. Note that if
      CONFIG_UART_NATIVE_PTY_0_ON_STDINOUT is set this property is effectively ignored.
      It is discouraged to use this property with the shell interactively: The default terminal
      configuration is not appropriate for Zephyr's shell interactive use and several shell
      functions like autocomplete or the history search will appear faulty.
