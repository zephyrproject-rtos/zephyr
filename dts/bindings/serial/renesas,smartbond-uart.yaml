      DTR pin specification. DTR pin when active tells that the driver that there
      is active client on the other side of serial line.
      The device driver does not use DTR for hardware flow control.
      When device is connected to computer serial converter usually asserts DTR
      line when serial port is opened and ready for communication.
      This line can be used in Smartbond(tm) driver to detect remote client presence.
      If client is not present the device can disable UART, allowing for
      power system management to enter more efficient power levels.
