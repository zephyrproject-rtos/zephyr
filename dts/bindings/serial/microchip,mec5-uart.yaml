  fifo-mode-disable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Disable 16550 FIFO mode. Both 16-byte TX and RX FIFOs will be
      disabled. UART will revert to a one byte holding register for
      TX and RX.

  rx-fifo-trig:
    type: string
    default: "8"
    description: |
      RX FIFO byte count trigger limit. When the number of received bytes
      reaches this level the UART will signal an interrupt if enabled.
    enum:
      - "1"
      - "4"
      - "8"
      - "14"

  use-extclk:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Optional source of an external UART clock. If present the
      driver will use this pin as the UART input clock source.
      The pin should have a 1.8432 MHz clock waveform for normal
      UART BAUD rates or 48 MHz for high speed BAUD rates.
      Refer to data sheet for the pin(s) available as external UART
      clock input. The pin should be added to the default PINCTRL list.
      Example using external 1.8432MHz clock on MEC5 external UART clock pin.

        clock-frequency = <1843200>;
        pinctrl-0 = < &uart1_tx_gpio170 &uart1_tx_gpio171 &uart_clk_gpio025>;
        pinctrl-names = "default";
