        The TX pin to use.

        For pins P0.0 through P0.31, use the pin number. For example,
        to use P0.16 for TX, set:

          tx-pin = <16>;

        For pins P1.0 through P1.31, add 32 to the pin number. For
        example, to use P1.2 for TX, set:

          tx-pin = <34>;  /* 32 + 2 */
