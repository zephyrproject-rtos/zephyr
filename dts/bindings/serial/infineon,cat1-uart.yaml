      PORT pin configuration for TX, RX, RTS, CTS signals.
      We expect that the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes. These
      nodes will have a nodelabel that matches the Infineon SoC Pinctrl
      defines and be of the form p<port>_<pin><peripheral inst>_<signal>.

      Examples
         use TX, RX
         pinctrl-0 = <&p5_1_scb5_uart_tx &p5_0_scb5_uart_rx>;

         use RX only
         pinctrl-0 = <&p5_0_scb5_uart_rx>;

         use TX, RX, RTS, CTS
         pinctrl-0 = <&p3_1_scb2_uart_tx &p3_0_scb2_uart_rx
                      &p3_2_scb2_uart_rts &p3_3_scb2_uart_cts>;
