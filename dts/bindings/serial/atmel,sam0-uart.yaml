    dmas:
      description: |
        Optional TX & RX dma specifiers.  Each specifier will have a phandle
        reference to the dmac controller, the channel number, and peripheral
        trigger source.

        For example dmas for TX, RX on SERCOM3
           dmas = <&dmac 0 0xb>, <&dmac 0 0xa>;

    dma-names:
      description: |
        Required if the dmas property exists.  This should be "tx" and "rx"
        to match the dmas property.

        For example
           dma-names = "tx", "rx";
