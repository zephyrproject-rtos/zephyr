      description: |
        Port pin configuration for RX & TX signals.  We expect that the
        phandles will reference pinctrl nodes.  These nodes will have a
        nodelabel that matches the Cypress SoC HAL defines and be of the
        form p<port>_<pin>_<periph><inst>_<signal>.

        For example the UART on PSoC-63 Pioneer Kit would be
           pinctrl-0 = <&p5_0_uart5_rx &p5_1_uart5_tx>;
