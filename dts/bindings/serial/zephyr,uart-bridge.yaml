title: UART bridge

description: |
  Bridges data between two serial devices, for example a USB CDC-ACM serial
  port and an hardware UART.

  The device node must specify exactly two peer phandles for the two serial
  devices to be bridged together. Example configuration:

  uart-bridge {
           compatible = "zephyr,uart-bridge";
           peers = <&cdc_acm_uart0 &uart1>;
  };

compatible: "zephyr,uart-bridge"

properties:
  peers:
    type: phandles
