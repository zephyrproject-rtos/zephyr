      Initial baudrate to establish Baudrate for communication on the UART port.
      This will be used for initial modem communication, which afterwards will
      be changed to the baudrate set on the peripheral. For instance: Starting
      at 9600 bps, but then switched up to 115200.
    default: 9600
    enum: [4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200, 230400, 460800]

      run-time through GNSS APIs. Must be greater than 50-ms.
      Default is power-on setting.
