  NXP SC18IS606 I2C to SPI/GPIO bridge.

  The SC18IS606 supports both an external SPI and GPIO controller.
  These controllers have to be added  to the Device Tree as children, while
  the device itself has to be a child of a I2C controller.
  Do note that this device only supports 3 SPI devices on the bus.

  An example configuration:

  &i2c0 {
    status = "okay";
    pinctrl-0 = <&i2c0_default>;
    pinctrl-names = "default";

    sc18is606: sc18is606 {
      compatible = "nxp,sc18is606";
      status = "okay";


      spi_ext: sc18is606_spi {
        compatible = "nxp,sc18is606-spi";
        status = "okay";
        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <0>;
      };
    };
  };

compatible: "nxp,sc18is606"

      Driver reset pin of the bridge.
      If connected directly to the MCU, this pin should be configured
      as active low.

    description:
      Driver interrupt pin of the bridge, this allows the driver to ensure
      that SPI transactions are done before allowing other transactions.
      If connected directly to the MCU, this pin should be configured
      as active low.
