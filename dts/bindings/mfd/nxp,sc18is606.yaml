  NXP SC18IS606 I2C to SPI/GPIO bridge.

  The SC18IS606 is supports both an external SPI and GPIO controller.
  These controllers have to be added  to the Device Tree as children, While
  the device itself has to be a child of a I2C controller.

  An example configuration:

  &i2c0 {
    status = "okay";
    pinctrl-0 = <&i2c0_default>;
    pinctrl-names = "default";

    sc18is606: sc18is606 {
      compatible ="nxp, sc18is606";
      status = "okay";


      spi_ext: sc18is606_spi {
        compatible = "nxp,sc18is606-spi";
        status = "okay";
        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <0>;
      };
    };
  };
