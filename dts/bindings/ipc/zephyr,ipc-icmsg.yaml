properties:
  tx-region:
    description: phandle to the shared memory region used for data transmission
    required: true
    type: phandle

  rx-region:
    description: phandle to the shared memory region used for data reception
    required: true
    type: phandle

  unbound:
    type: string
    enum:
      - disable
      - enable
      - detect
    default: disable
    description: |
      Select unbound() callback mode. The callback can be enabled or disabled with the
      "enable" and "disable" option respectively. This functionality requires session
      number handshake procedure on both sides, so you cannot set "enable" on one side
      and "disable" on the other. The "detect" mode detects if the remote side
      supports handshake procedure and adjusts its behavior accordingly. The
      "detect" mode is possible only if "dcache-alignment" is at least 8 bytes.

  dcache-alignment:
    type: int
    description: |
      Data cache alignment. If any side of the communication uses cache on
      rx-region/tx-region this property must be the biggest value of the
      invalidation or the write-back size for both sides of the communication.
      If no side of the communication uses data cache this property could be
      safely omitted.
      For example:
        Side A: no data cache
        Side B: 32 Bytes write-back size, 16 Bytes invalidation size
        dcache-alignment = <32>; for both

    required: true

  mbox-names:
