properties:
  tx-region:
    description: phandle to the shared memory region used for data transmission
    required: true
    type: phandle

  rx-region:
    description: phandle to the shared memory region used for data reception
    required: true
    type: phandle

  dcache-alignment:
    type: int
    description: |
      Data cache alignment. If any side of the communication uses cache on
      rx-region/tx-region this property must be the biggest value of the
      invalidation or the write-back size for both sides of the communication.
      If no side of the communication uses data cache this property could be
      safely omitted.
      For example:
        Side A: no data cache
        Side B: 32 Bytes write-back size, 16 Bytes invalidation size
        dcache-alignment = 32; for both
