      ICBMsg uses atomic_t variables in status block.
      As atomic_t variable size is architecture dependent, this property
      makes sure that the alignment of status block fields are the same on each core.
      It needs to be set to the biggest size of atomic_t variable used in the system.
      Leave it set to 0 (default) if both cores use the same size of atomic operations.
