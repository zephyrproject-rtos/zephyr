      Delay in nanoseconds from the chip select assert to the first clock
      edge. If not set, the minimum supported delay is used.

  sck-pcs-delay:
    type: int
    description: |
      Delay in nanoseconds from the last clock edge to the chip select
      deassert. If not set, the minimum supported delay is used.

  transfer-delay:
    type: int
    description: |
      Delay in nanoseconds from the chip select deassert to the next chip
      select assert. If not set, the minimum supported delay is used.

      Configures which pins (SDO and SDI) are used for input and output data
      during single bit transfers.

  tristate-output:
    type: boolean
    description:
      Configures whether or not the output data is tristated between accesses
      (when PCS is negated). If set, the output will be tristated when PCS is negated,
      otherwise the output line retains the last value when PCS is negated.
