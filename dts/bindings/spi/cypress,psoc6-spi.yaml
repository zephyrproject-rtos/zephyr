      Port pin configuration for the various SPI signals that includes
      MISO, MOSI, SCK, and possibly various chip selects signals.  We
      expect that the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes.  These
      nodes will have a nodelabel that matches the Cypress SoC HAL defines
      and be of the form p<port>_<pin>_<periph><inst>_<signal>.

      For example the SPI on PSoC-63 Pioneer Kit would be
         pinctrl-0 = <&p12_0_spi6_mosi &p12_1_spi6_miso &p12_2_spi6_clk &p12_3_spi6_sel0>;
