    pcs-sck-delay:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        Delay in nanoseconds from the chip select assert to the first clock
        edge. If not set, the minimum supported delay is used.

    sck-pcs-delay:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        Delay in nanoseconds from the last clock edge to the chip select
        deassert. If not set, the minimum supported delay is used.

    transfer-delay:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        Delay in nanoseconds from the chip select deassert to the next chip
        select assert. If not set, the minimum supported delay is used.

    pinctrl-0:
      type: phandles
      required: true

    nxp,rx-tx-chn-share:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: If the edma channel shared with tx and rx

    ctar:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        ctar register selection range form 0-1 for master mode, 0 for slave mode

    sample-point:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        Controls when the DSPI master samples SIN in the Modified Transfer Format.
        This field is valid only when the CPHA bit in the CTAR register is 0.

    continuous-sck:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: |
        continuous SCK enable. Note that the continuous SCK is only
        supported for CPHA = 1.

    rx-fifo-overwrite:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: |
        receive FIFO overflow overwrite enable. If ROOE = 0, the incoming
        data is ignored and the data from the transfer that generated the overflow
        is also ignored. If ROOE = 1, the incoming data is shifted to the
        shift register.

    modified-timing-format:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: |
        Enables a modified transfer format to be used if true.

    tx-fifo-size:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        tx fifo size

    rx-fifo-size:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        rx fifo size
