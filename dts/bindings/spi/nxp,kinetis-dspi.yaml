  pcs-sck-delay:
    type: int
    description: |
      Delay in nanoseconds from the chip select assert to the first clock
      edge. If not set, the minimum supported delay is used.

  sck-pcs-delay:
    type: int
    description: |
      Delay in nanoseconds from the last clock edge to the chip select
      deassert. If not set, the minimum supported delay is used.

  transfer-delay:
    type: int
    description: |
      Delay in nanoseconds from the chip select deassert to the next chip
      select assert. If not set, the minimum supported delay is used.

  pinctrl-0:
    required: true

  nxp,rx-tx-chn-share:
    type: boolean
    description: If the edma channel shared with tx and rx

  ctar:
    type: int
    description: |
      ctar register selection range form 0-1 for master mode, 0 for slave mode

  sample-point:
    type: int
    description: |
      Controls when the DSPI master samples SIN in the Modified Transfer Format.
      This field is valid only when the CPHA bit in the CTAR register is 0.

  continuous-sck:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      continuous SCK enable. Note that the continuous SCK is only
      supported for CPHA = 1.

  rx-fifo-overwrite:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      receive FIFO overflow overwrite enable. If ROOE = 0, the incoming
      data is ignored and the data from the transfer that generated the overflow
      is also ignored. If ROOE = 1, the incoming data is shifted to the
      shift register.

  modified-timing-format:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enables a modified transfer format to be used if true.

  tx-fifo-size:
    type: int
    description: |
      tx fifo size

  rx-fifo-size:
    type: int
    description: |
      rx fifo size
