    description: |
      Connects TX to RX internally creating a loop back connection. Useful
      for testing.

  dmas:
    description: |
      TX & RX dma specifiers.  Each specifier will have a phandle
      reference to the dma controller, the channel number, and peripheral
      trigger source. The channel number is arbitrary but must not be
      reused. The number of channels available is device dependent.

      For example dmas for TX and RX may look like
         dmas = <&xdmac 1 DMA_PERID_SPI0_TX>, <&xdmac 2 DMA_PERID_SPI0_RX>;

  dma-names:
    description: |
      This should be "tx" and "rx" and should match the order given for
      dmas.

      For example using the example dmas, an example dma-names would be
         dma-names = "tx", "rx";
