    description: |
      The number of the Chip Select signals.

    description: |
      Module clock frequency in Hz.

    type: boolean
    description: |
      Select if the SPI module is intended to be used in slave mode.

  spi-sck-cs-delay:
    type: int
    description: |
      A delay in nanoseconds between the stop of clock signal and
      deactivating Chip Select at the stop of transfer. If CS remains
      asserted between transfer, this delay will be inserted between transfer.
      If not set, the minimum supported delay is used.
      This value will affect to all inner CS signals of SPI module when active.
      This value will not be applied for CS lines controlled by GPIO.

  spi-cs-sck-delay:
    type: int
    description: |
      A delay in nanoseconds between activating Chip Select and the start
      of clock signal at the start of transfer. If CS remains asserted
      between transfer, this delay will be inserted between transfer.
      If not set, the minimum supported delay is used.
      This value will affect to all inner CS signals of SPI module when active.
      This value will not be applied for CS lines controlled by GPIO.

  spi-cs-cs-delay:
    type: int
    description: |
      A delay in nanoseconds between deactivating Chip Select at the stop
      of previous transfer and activating Chip Select at the start of
      next transfer. If CS remains asserted between transfer, this delay
      will not be inserted.
      If not set, the minimum supported delay is used.
      This value will affect to all inner CS signals of SPI module when active.
      This value will not be applied for CS lines controlled by GPIO.
