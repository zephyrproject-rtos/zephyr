properties:
  anomaly-58-workaround:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enables the workaround for the nRF52832 SoC SPIM PAN 58 anomaly.
      Must be used in conjunction with
      CONFIG_SOC_NRF52832_ALLOW_SPIM_DESPITE_PAN_58=y

  rx-delay-supported:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Indicates if the SPIM instance has the capability of delaying MISO
      sampling. This property needs to be defined at SoC level DTS files.

  rx-delay:
    type: int
    enum:
      - 0
      - 1
      - 2
      - 3
      - 4
      - 5
      - 6
      - 7
    description: |
      Number of 64 MHz clock cycles (15.625 ns) delay from the sampling edge
      of SCK (leading or trailing, depending on the CPHA setting used) until
      the input serial data on MISO is actually sampled. This property does
      not have any effect if the rx-delay-supported property is not set.
