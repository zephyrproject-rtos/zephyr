description: Nordic nRF family SPIM (SPI master with EasyDMA)

compatible: "nordic,nrf-spim"

include: ["nordic,nrf-spi-common.yaml", "memory-region.yaml"]

properties:
  rx-delay-supported:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Indicates if the SPIM instance has the capability of delaying MISO
      sampling. This property needs to be defined at SoC level DTS files.

  rx-delay:
    type: int
    enum:
      - 0
      - 1
      - 2
      - 3
      - 4
      - 5
      - 6
      - 7
    description: |
      Number of 64 MHz clock cycles (15.625 ns) delay from the sampling edge
      of SCK (leading or trailing, depending on the CPHA setting used) until
      the input serial data on MISO is actually sampled. This property does
      not have any effect if the rx-delay-supported property is not set.

  cross-power-domain-gpios:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Select P2 pins can be used for some serial interfaces in the peripheral domain,
      when the device is in Constant Latency sub-power mode. This property notifies
      the driver that this SPIM instance uses cross power-domain GPIOs, and therefore
      requests the appropriate sub-power mode while active.

      Only valid for SPIM20 on nRF54L devices. Depends on CONFIG_NRF_SYS_EVENT.
