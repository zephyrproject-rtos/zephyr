  dcsckon:
    type: int
    description: |
      Delay in QSPI main clocks from CS# assertion to first clock edge.
      If not present use hardware default value. Refer to chip documention
      for QMSPI input clock frequency.

  dckcsoff:
    type: int
    description: |
      Delay in QSPI main clocks from last clock edge to CS# de-assertion.
      If not presetn use hardware default value. Refer to chip documention
      for QSPI input clock frequency.

  dldh:
    type: int
    description: |
      Delay in QSPI main clocks from CS# de-assertion to driving HOLD#
      and WP#. If not present use hardware default value. Refer to chip
      documention for QSPI input clock frequency.

  dcsda:
    type: int
    description: |
      Delay in QSPI main clocks from CS# de-assertion to CS# assertion.
      If not present use hardware default value. Refer to chip documention
      for QSPI input clock frequency.

  ctrl-tap:
    type: int
    description: Select control tap point. Values are in [0, 255].

  clock-tap:
    type: int
    description: |
      Select clock tap point to offset any off chip delays. Values are in [0, 255].
