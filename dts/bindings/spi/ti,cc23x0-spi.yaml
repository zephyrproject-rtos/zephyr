  dmas:
    description: |
      Optional TX & RX DMA specifiers. Each specifier will have a phandle
      reference to the DMA controller, the channel number, and the peripheral
      trigger source.

      Example for channels 0/1 with spi0txtrg/spi0rxtrg trigger sources:
        dmas = <&dma 0 0>, <&dma 1 1>;

  dma-names:
    description: |
      Required if the dmas property exists. This should be "tx" and "rx"
      to match the dmas property.

      Example:
        dma-names = "tx", "rx";
