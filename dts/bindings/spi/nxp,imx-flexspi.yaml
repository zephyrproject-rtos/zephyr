properties:
  reg:
    required: true
    description: |
      FlexSPI controller register space and AHB memory windows.
      reg[0]: FlexSPI controller registers
      reg[1]: AHB flash memory windows for XIP

  port-count:
    type: int
    default: 4
    description: Number of FlexSPI ports supported by this controller

  ahb-port-bases:
    type: array
    description: |
      AHB base addresses for each FlexSPI port (0-3).
      Specify the AHB window base address for each port directly.
      Use 0 for unused ports.
      Example: <0x18000000 0 0x38000000 0> means:
        - Port 0: 0x18000000
        - Port 1: unused (0)
        - Port 2: 0x38000000
        - Port 3: unused (0)
      If omitted, falls back to legacy single window behavior.

  interrupts:
    required: true

  ahb-bufferable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable AHB bufferable write access by setting register field
      AHBCR[BUFFERABLEEN].

  ahb-cacheable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable AHB cacheable read access by setting register field
      AHBCR[CACHEABLEEN].

  ahb-prefetch:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable AHB read prefetch by setting register field AHBCR[PREFETCHEN].

  ahb-read-addr-opt:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Remove burst start address alignment limitation by setting register
      field AHBCR[READADDROPT].

  combination-mode:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Combine port A and port B data pins to support octal mode access by
      setting register field MCR0[COMBINATIONEN].

  sck-differential-clock:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable/disable SCKB pad use as SCKA differential clock output,
      when enabled, Port B flash access is not available.

  rx-clock-source:
    type: int
    default: 0
    enum:
      - 0 # Loopback internally
      - 1 # Loopback from DQS pad
      - 2 # Loopback from SCK pad
      - 3 # External input from DQS pad
    description: |
      Source clock for flash read. See the RXCLKSRC field in register MCR0.
      The default corresponds to the reset value of the register field.

  rx-clock-source-b:
    type: int
    default: 0
    enum:
      - 0 # Loopback internally
      - 1 # Loopback from DQS pad
      - 2 # Loopback from SCK pad
      - 3 # External input from DQS pad
    description: |
      Source clock for flash read on port B. Only supported by some instances
      of this IP. See the RXCLKSRC_B field in register MCR2.
      The default corresponds to the reset value of the register field.

  rx-buffer-config:
    type: array
    description: |
      Array of tuples to configure AHB RX buffers. Format is the following:
      <prefetch priority master_id buf_size>. Pass multiple tuples to configure
      multiple RX buffers (up to maximum supported by SOC).
      The tuple fields correspond to the following register bitfields:
      prefetch: AHBRXBUFxCRx[PREFETCH]
      priority: AHBRXBUFxCRx[PRIORITY]
      master_id: AHBRXBUFxCRx[MSTRID]
      buf_size: AHBRXBUFxCRx[BUFSZ]

  ahb-boundary:
    type: string
    default: "no-boundary"
    enum:
      - "no-boundary"
      - "1024"
      - "512"
      - "256"
    description: |
      Sets the AHB read/write boundary. Only supported by some versions of
      the FLEXSPI IP. When set, all memory accesses that cross an address
      boundary of the specified size will be divided into smaller sub accesses.
