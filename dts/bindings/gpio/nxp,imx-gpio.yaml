        IMX pin selection peripheral does not follow specific
        pattern for which GPIO port uses which pinmux. Use this property to specify
        pinctrl nodes to use for the gpio port when CONFIG_PINCTRL=y. Note that
        the order of the nodes matters. The first node for gpio1 will be used
        as the pinmux for gpio0, port 0.
