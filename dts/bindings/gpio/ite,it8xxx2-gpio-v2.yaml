      Selection of support input voltage 3.3V or 1.8V.

      WUCs are mapped to the pins of GPIO.
      The WUC groups internal and external inputs, and asserts
      a wake-up signal to the INTC, allowing the CPU to exit
      Doze/Deep Doze/Sleep modes.

  wuc-mask:
    type: array

  keyboard-controller:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      When set, this GPIO controller has pins associated with the
      keyboard controller. In this case the reg_gpcr property is
      overloaded and used to write the keyboard GCTRL register.
      This setting will be found in the gpio_ite_configure function
      when the judgment of gpio_config->ksb_ctrl is true.
      The GPIO control register that will be set for these three
      nodes is as follows:
      gpioksi:  0xf01d40-0xf01d47
      gpioksol: 0xf01d48-0xf01d4f
      gpioksoh: 0xf01d50-0xf01d57

gpio-cells:
  - pin
  - flags
