    GPIO pins exposed on Seeeduino Xiao (and compatible devices) pads.

    Some Seeeeduino Xiao layout providing pads for connecting with pogo
    spring contact pins, along opposite rows on the bottom of the board.

    Proceeding counter-clockwise:
    * A 4-pin pad row of Digital/Analog Input signals.  This has signals
      labeled from 11 at the top through 14 at the bottom.
    * A 4-pin pad row of Digital/Analog Input signals.  This has signals
      labeled 18 at the top through 15 at the bottom.

    This binding provides a nexus mapping for 8 pins where parent pins 0
    through 7 correspond to D11 through D18, as depicted below:

        0 D11 (A11/RX1)    (CS1n/A18) D18 7
        1 D12 (A12/TX1)    (SCK1/A17) D17 6
        2 D13 (A13/SCL1)  (MISO1/A16) D16 5
        3 D14 (A14/SDA1)  (MOSI1/A15) D15 4
