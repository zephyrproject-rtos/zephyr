    description: |
      The clocks property is optional for STM32MP2 GPIO controllers.
      This property is not required when the Cortex-A core is responsible for
      GPIO initialization and acts as the resource manager, as defined by the
      RIF (Resource Isolation Framework) peripheral. Adding the GPIO clocks
      in that case would only trigger an IAC event.
      If the Cortex-M core is designated as the resource manager, then the
      clocks property must be defined and added to the device tree.
