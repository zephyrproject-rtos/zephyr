title: GPIO pins exposed on the Raspberry Pi CSI Camera connector

description: |
  There are 2 variants of the Raspberry Pi CSI camera connector. Either 15-pin
  or 22-pin. Here only GPIO provided by those connectors are abstracted since
  others pins are directly connected to CSI PHY.
  For reference, pinout of 15-pin and 22-pin connectors are references below.
  In this gpio nexus, only GPIOs are represented and should be described in
  the following way, allowing to have a single compatible for both 15-pin
  and 22-pin connectors and also allowing to deal with 15-pin to 22-pin
  conversion cables.

  Nexus mapping:
    1   IO0      pin 11 (15-pin based) / pin 17 (22-pin based)
    2   IO1      pin 12 (15-pin based) / pin 18 (22-pin based)
    3   I2C_SCL  pin 13 (15-pin based) / pin 20 (22-pin based)
    4   I2C_SDA  pin 14 (15-pin based) / pin 21 (22-pin based)

  Use CSI_* constants in <zephyr/dt-bindings/gpio/raspberrypi-csi-connector.h>
  to refer to specific pins using convenient constant names.

  For reference only, Raspberry 15-pin Connector layout:

    10  GND
    11  IO0
