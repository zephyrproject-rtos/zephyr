title: GPIO pins exposed on the Raspberry Pi CSI Camera connector

description: |
  There are 2 variants of the Raspberry Pi CSI camera connector. Either 15-pin
  or 22-pin. Here only GPIO provided by those connectors are abstracted since
  others pins are directly connected to CSI PHY.
  For reference, pinout of 15-pin and 22-pin connectors are references below.
  In this gpio nexus, only GPIOs are represented and should be described in
  the following way, allowing to have a single compatible for both 15-pin
  and 22-pin connectors and also allowing to deal with 15-pin to 22-pin
  conversion cables.

  Nexus mapping:
    1   IO0      pin 11 (15-pin based) / pin 17 (22-pin based)
    2   IO1      pin 12 (15-pin based) / pin 18 (22-pin based)
    3   I2C_SCL  pin 13 (15-pin based) / pin 20 (22-pin based)
    4   I2C_SDA  pin 14 (15-pin based) / pin 21 (22-pin based)

  For reference only, Raspberry 15-pin Connector layout:
    1   GND
    2   CSI_D0_N
    3   CSI_D0_P
    4   GND
    5   CSI_D1_N
    6   CSI_D1_P
    7   GND
    8   CSI_CK_N
    9   CSI_CK_P
    10  GND
    11  IO0
    12  IO1
    13  I2C_SCL
    14  I2C_SDA
    15  VCC (3v3)

  For reference only, Raspberry 22-pin Connector layout:

    1	GND
    2	CSI_D0_N
    3	CSI_D0_P
    4	GND
    5	CSI_D1_N
    6	CSI_D1_P
    7	GND
    8	CSI_CK_N
    9	CSI_CK_P
    10	GND
    11	CSI_D2_N
    12	CSI_D2_P
    13	GND
    14	CSI_D3_N
    15	CSI_D3_P
    16	GND
    17	IO0
    18	IO1
    19	GND
    20	I2C_SCL
    21	I2C_SDA
    22	VCC (3v3)
