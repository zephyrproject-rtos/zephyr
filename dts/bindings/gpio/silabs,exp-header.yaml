title: Silicon Labs Kit Expansion Header

description: |
  GPIO pins exposed on the Expansion Header of Silicon Labs Pro Kits, Wireless Pro Kits,
  Starter Kits and Wireless Starter Kits. Dev Kits also use the Expansion Header pinout
  for their breakout pads.

  The Expansion Header contains several I/O pins as well as VMCU, 3.3V and 5V power rails.

    20 -o 3V3            BOARD_ID_SDA o- 19
    18 -o 5V             BOARD_ID_SCL o- 17
    16 -o I2C SDA             I2C SCL o- 15
    14 -o UART RX                GPIO o- 13
    12 -o UART TX                GPIO o- 11
    10 -o SPI CS                 GPIO o- 9
     8 -o SPI CLK                GPIO o- 7
     6 -o SPI CIPO               GPIO o- 5
     4 -o SPI COPI               GPIO o- 3
     2 -o VMCU                    GND o- 1

  Note: The BOARD_ID I2C lines are connected to the debugger, not to the SoC, so the usable
  GPIOs range from pin 3 to pin 16. Not all pins are routed on all boards, depending on the
  SoC used and board design.
