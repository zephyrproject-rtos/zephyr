            Mapping table between Wake-Up Input (WUI) and 8 IOs belong to this device.
            Please notice not all IOs connect to WUIs.
            In this case, it will be presented by wui_none.

            For example the WUI mapping on NPCX7 GPIO8 would be
               wui-maps = <&wui_io80 &wui_io81 &wui_io82 &wui_io83
                           &wui_none &wui_none &wui_io86 &wui_io87>;

            Mapping table between Low-Voltage controllers and 8 IOs belong to
            this device. Please notice not all IOs support Low-Voltage detection.
            In this case, it will be presented by lvol_none.

            For example the LVOL mapping on NPCX7 GPIOC would be
               lvol-maps = <&lvol_none &lvol_ioc1 &lvol_ioc2 &lvol_none
                            &lvol_none &lvol_ioc5 &lvol_ioc6 &lvol_ioc7>;
