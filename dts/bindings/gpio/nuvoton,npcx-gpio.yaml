        Mapping table between Wake-Up Input (WUI) and 8 IOs belong to this device.
        Please notice not all IOs connect to WUIs.
        In this case, it will be presented by wui_none.

        For example the WUI mapping on NPCX7 GPIO8 would be
           wui-maps = <&wui_io80 &wui_io81 &wui_io82 &wui_io83
                       &wui_none &wui_none &wui_io86 &wui_io87>;

        Mapping table between Low-Voltage controllers and 8 IOs belong to
        this device. Please notice not all IOs support Low-Voltage detection.
        In this case, it will be presented by lvol_none.

        For example the LVOL mapping on NPCX7 GPIOC would be
           lvol-maps = <&lvol_none &lvol_ioc1 &lvol_ioc2 &lvol_none
                        &lvol_none &lvol_ioc5 &lvol_ioc6 &lvol_ioc7>;
