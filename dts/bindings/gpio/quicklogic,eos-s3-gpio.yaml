        This property is used to preconfigure the GPIOs and connect them to
        a primary(0) or a secondary(1) pin. EOS S3 supports up to 8 GPIOs
        which can be configured as follows
        "GPIO_NUM : primary_pin_num / secondary_pin_num"
        "0 : 6 / 24"
        "1 : 9 / 26"
        "2 : 11 / 28"
        "3 : 14 / 30"
        "4 : 18 / 31"
        "5 : 21 / 36"
        "6 : 22 / 38"
        "7 : 23 / 45"
        E.g. configuring GPIO 2 as secondary results in controlling pin 28,
        to do so set the bit on the 2nd index of this property
        "pin-secondary-config = <0x04>;"

  - pin
