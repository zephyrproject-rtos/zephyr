          This property is used to preconfigure the GPIOs and connect them to
          a primary(0) or a secondary(1) pin. EOS S3 supports up to 8 GPIOs
          which can be configured as follows
          "GPIO_NUM : primary_pin_num / secondary_pin_num"
          "0 : 6 / 24"
          "1 : 9 / 26"
          "2 : 11 / 28"
          "3 : 14 / 30"
          "4 : 18 / 31"
          "5 : 21 / 36"
          "6 : 22 / 38"
          "7 : 23 / 45"
          E.g. configuring GPIO 2 as secondary results in controlling pin 28,
          to do so set the bit on the 2nd index of this property
          "pin-secondary-config = <0x04>;"
