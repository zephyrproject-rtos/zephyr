      This parameter enables to add proper offset to access
      GPIO_INT_EN register from General Purpose Events status
      Register, as it is observed that the offset varies from
      platform to platform. GP_EVENT_STAT register is fetched
      from ACPI GPIO table.

    description: |
      This boolean will indicate the version of GINF method ACPI
      enabled for a given platform. If the value is true, GINF
      method which takes 3 parameters (u-id, bank-id and field-id)
      will be used else GINF method with 2 parameters (field-id
      and bank-id) will be used.
