    GPIO pins exposed on a Digilent Pmod interface.

    This binding provides a nexus mapping for 8 pins where parent pins 0
    through 3 correspond to IO1 through IO4, and parent pins 4 through 7
    correspond to IO5 through IO8, as depicted below for a 12-pin connector.

    12-pin Pmod interface:

        0 IO1                    IO5   4
        1 IO2                    IO6   5
        2 IO3                    IO7   6
        3 IO4                    IO8   7
        - GND                    GND   -
        - VDD                    VDD   -

    This binding can also be used with the 6-pin Pmod connector variant which
    is a proper subset of the 12-pin connector. In that case parent pins 4
    through 7 are omitted from the GPIO nexus node, resulting in a mapping
    as depicted below.

    6-pin Pmod interface:

        0 IO1
        1 IO2
        2 IO3
        3 IO4
        - GND
        - VDD
