  Bee GPIO controller.
  First of all, a Pad of bee series soc refers to the physical pin exposed on the chip package
  (e.g., P0_0, P0_1). Most Pads can be configured via pinmuxing to function as GPIOs.

  In contrast, the GPIO in the driver refers to the peripheral control logic, which is distinct
  from the physical Pads. A single GPIO port consists of 32 logical pins (e.g., GPIOA_0...GPIOA_31).

  Typically, a logical GPIO pin (e.g., GPIOA_0) is statically mapped to a fixed Pad (e.g., P0_0).
  However, certain GPIO pins support flexible mapping, allowing a single logical pin to be routed
  to different physical Pads.

  Note that only one mapping configuration can be active at any given time. Users must pre-configure
  the specific GPIO mux in the pinctrl node of the device tree using the correct macro (e.g.,
  BEE_PSEL_GPIOA_0_P0_0) to prevent the GPIO pin from being routed to the wrong Pad.

  Example Usage
    &gpioa {
      pinctrl-0 = <&gpioa_default>;
      pinctrl-names = "default";
      status = "okay";
    };

    &leds {
        compatible = "gpio-leds";
        led0: led_0 {
            /* Logical GPIO pin 0 */
            gpios = <&gpioa 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
        };
    };

    &pinctrl {
        gpioa_default: gpioa_default {
            group1 {
                /* Pinmux: Mapping GPIOA_0 to Pad P0_0 */
                psels = <BEE_PSEL_GPIOA_0_P0_0>;
            };
        };
    };
