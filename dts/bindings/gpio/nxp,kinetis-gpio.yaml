      A phandle reference to the device tree node that contains the pinmux
      port associated with this GPIO controller.

      Describes an offset between inst index and actual GPIO port number.

  wakeup-line:
    type: int
    description: |
      On some NXP platforms, GPIO can wake up the MCU from low power mode,
      but the wakeup capability is configured through a specific peripheral.
      Such as the wakeup unit. We need to use the wakeup unit peripheral to
      configure which GPIO and which signal can wake up the MCU from low power
      mode.
      Note: Users need to configure this property according to the options
      provided in 'zephyr/dt-bindings/gpio/nxp-kinetis-gpio', The driver will
      parses this property and configures the wakeup uint.

gpio-cells:
  - pin
  - flags
