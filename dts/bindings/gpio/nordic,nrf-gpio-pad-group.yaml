  Nordic nRF GPIO pad group.

  The GPIO pad group describes the pads (package
  pins of the SoC) the GPIO controller manages.

  The pads may be in a different power domain than
  the GPIO controller, and may require enabling
  retention to preserve the GPIO configuration if
  the power domain is suspended.

  The GPIO pad group is a child node of the GPIO
  controller which manages the pad group, named
  pad-group. The pad group's nodelabel is named
  gpio_pad_group<GPIO number>.

  Example layout:

    gpio0: gpio@938000 {
            compatible = "nordic,nrf-gpio";

            ...

            gpio_pad_group0: pad-group {
                    compatible = "nordic,nrf-gpio-pad-group";
                    power-domains = <&gdpwr_slow_main>;
                    retain-mask = <0xFFF>;
            };
    };

compatible: "nordic,nrf-gpio-pad-group"

      Mask of pins which shall be retained if pad
      group's power domain is powered off.
