  nint-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Connection for the NINT signal. This signal is active-low when
      produced by tca9538 GPIO node.

  input-latch:
    type: int
    description: |
      Input latch register bit is 0 by default and the input pin state
      is not latched. When input latch register bit is 1 and the input
      pin state is latched.

  interrupt-mask:
    type: int
    description: |
      Interrupt mask register is set to logic 1 by default without
      enabling interrupts. Setting corresponding mask bits to logic
      0 to enable the interrupts.
