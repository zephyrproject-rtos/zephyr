      The default value corresponds to the default value of the hardware.
      Wire break is disabled in all channels.
      WBE bit in all Filter registers stand for wire break enable on each
      channel, so to enable WB functionality set 1.
      If WB on specific channel is disabled , FAULT will not be rised in case
      wire is cut.
