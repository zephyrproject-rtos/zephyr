  GPIO pins exposed on ST Morpho connector.

  The ST morpho connector consists in male pin headers (CN7 and CN10 in case of
  Nucleo-64, CN11 and CN12 in case of Nucleo-144) accessible on both sides of
  any Nucleo board. They can be used to connect shields. All signals and power
  pins of the STM32 are available on the ST morpho connector.

  Use ST_MORPHO_* constants in <zephyr/dt-bindings/gpio/st-morpho-header.h>
  to refer to specific pins using convenient constant names.

compatible: "st-morpho-header"
