    ENE KB1200 GPIO Port

    The GPIO controller provides group control of GPIO functions. Each port
    group contains 32 pins. GPIO_00~GPIO_1F belong to the Port0 group,
    GPIO_20~GPIO_3F belong to the Port1 group, and so on.

    In particular, the 32 pins of the port group do not share the same IRQ
    interrupt, but are assigned to two different IRQ interrupts in groups of 16
    pins. This means that single port group provide two interrupt source.
    ex.Port0 group GPIO_00~GPIO_0F shares IRQ18, and Port0 group
    GPIO_10~GPIO_1F shares IRQ19.
