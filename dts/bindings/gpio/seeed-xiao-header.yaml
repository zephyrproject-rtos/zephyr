    GPIO pins exposed on Seeeduino Xiao (and compatible devices) headers.

    The Seeeeduino Xiao layout provides two headers, along opposite
    edges of the board.

    Proceeding counter-clockwise:
    * A 7-pin Digital/Analog Input header.  This has input signals
      labeled from 0 at the top through 6 at the bottom.
    * A 7-pin header Power and Digital/Analog Input header.  This
      has three power pins, followed by four inputs labeled 10 at the
      top through 7 at the bottom.

    This binding provides a nexus mapping for 11 pins where parent pins 0
    through 10 correspond to D0 through D10, as depicted below:

        0 D0 (A0/DAC)                5V   -
        1 D1 (A1)                    GND  -
        2 D2 (A2)                    3V3  -
        3 D3 (A3/CS0n)   (MOSI0/A10) D10 10
        4 D4 (A4/SDA0)    (MISO0/A9) D9   9
        5 D5 (A5/SCL0)     (SCK0/A8) D8   8
        6 D6 (A6/TX0)  (RX0/CS0n/A7) D7   7
