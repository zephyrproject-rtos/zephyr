title: ArduCam 20-pin header camera connector.

description: |
  GPIO pins exposed on an ArduCam 20-pin header for camera modules.
  Originally designed to connect Arducam modules to Arduino Giga R1,
  but further used by other vendors of camera modules and devkits.

  The connector layout is depicted below:

     1   3V3          2   GND
     3   SCL          4   SDA
     5   VS           6   HS
     7   PCLK         8   XCLK
     9   D7           10  D6
     11  D5           12  D4
     13  D3           14  D2
     15  D1           16  D0
     17  PEN          18  PDN
     19  GPIO0        20  GPIO1

  In some variants, the last row containing the pins 19 and 20 is
  not present, and the module is only providing 18 pins out of 20.

  The following node labels can be used in devicetree:

  - dvp_20pin_interface: the video interface that receives the video
    feed and use with the zephyr,camera chosen node.

  - dvp_20pin_i2c: the I2C device of the devkit on which the camera
    module is instantiated.

  - dvp_20pin_connector: the GPIO nexus using the arducam,dvp-20pin-connector
    that defines the camera pins ('reset' (PEN), 'power-down' (PDN)...)

  See <zephyr/dt-bindings/gpio/dvp-20pin-connector.h> for pin description.
