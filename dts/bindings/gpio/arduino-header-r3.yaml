    GPIO pins exposed on Arduino Uno (R3) headers.

    The Arduino Uno layout provides four headers, two each along
    opposite edges of the board.

    Proceeding counter-clockwise:
    * An 8-pin Power Supply header.  No pins on this header are exposed
      by this binding.
    * A 6-pin Analog Input header.  This has analog input signals
      labeled from A0 at the top through A5 at the bottom.
    * An 8-pin header (opposite Analog Input).  This has digital input
      signals labeled from D0 at the bottom D7 at the top;
    * A 10-pin header (opposite Power Supply).  This has six additional
      digital input signals labelled from D8 at the bottom through D13
      towards the top, skipping two pins, then finishing with D14 and
      D15 at the top.

    This binding provides a nexus mapping for 20 pins where parent pins 0
    through 5 correspond to A0 through A5, and parent pins 6 through 21
    correspond to D0 through D15, as depicted below:

                                 D15  21
                                 D14  20
                                 AREF -

        - GND

        0 A0                     D5   11
        1 A1                     D4   10
        2 A2                     D3    9
        3 A3                     D2    8
        4 A4                     D1    7
        5 A5                     D0    6

    Use ARDUINO_HEADER_R3_* constants in <zephyr/dt-bindings/gpio/arduino-header-r3.h> to refer to
    specific pins using convenient constant names.
