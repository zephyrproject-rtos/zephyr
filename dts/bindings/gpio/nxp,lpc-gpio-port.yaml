      Interrupt source for the gpio port. For ports that can use the PINT
      as an interrupt source for their pins (typically ports 0 and 1),
      this can be set to PINT. Otherwise, the property should be set to "int-a"
      or "int-b" if interrupt support is desired, and the appropriate IRQ number
      should set for the device.
