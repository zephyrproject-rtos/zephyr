    GPIO pins exposed on Mikro BUS headers.

    The Mikro BUS layout provides two headers, aligned on the opposite
    edges of the board.

    This binding provides a nexus mapping for 10 pins, left side pins are
    numbered 0 - 5 (AN - MOSI), the right side pins are numbered 6 - 10
    (PWM - SDA). The bottom 2 pins on each side are used for input voltage
    and ground, they are not mapped in the nexus.

                           Analog - AN     PWM - PWM output
                            Reset - RST    INT - Hardware Interrupt
                  SPI Chip Select - CS      RX - UART Receive
                        SPI Clock - SCK     TX - UART Transmit
    SPI Master Input Slave Output - MISO   SCL - I2C Clock
    SPI Master Output Slave Input - MOSI   SDA - I2C Data
                   VCC-3.3V power - +3.3V  +5V - VCC-5V power
                 Reference Ground - GND    GND - Reference Ground

    Board's silkscreen may vary depending on your board, but coherent with
    the description above as it's according to the standard's specification.
