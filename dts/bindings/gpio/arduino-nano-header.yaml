    GPIO pins exposed on Arduino Nano headers.

    The Arduino Nano layout provides two headers on opposite edges of the board.

    * A 15-pin header with mostly digital signals. The additional NRST (pin3)
      and GND (pin 4) pins are not exposed by this binding.
    * A 15-pin Analog Input and power supply header. This has analog input
      signals labeled from A0 through A7, as well a digital signal D13. The
      power supply and reset pins are not exposed by this binding.

    This binding provides a nexus mapping for 22 pins where parent pins 0
    through 13 correspond to D0 through D13, and parent pins 14 through 21
    correspond to A0 through A7, as depicted below.
