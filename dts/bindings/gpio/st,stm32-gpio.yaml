        This property indicates the number of in-use slots of available slots
        for GPIOs. The STM32 GPIO controller typically has all 16 possible port
        IO with few exceptions. It should only be necessary to explicitly set
        this property if the controller itself does not implement all 16 port
        IO register bits; for example PORTE in the STM32WB55xx series which only
        implements the first 5. Package restrictions on the number of exposed
        GPIO should not influence this property. For cases in which there might
        be holes in the slot range, this value should be the max slot number+1.
