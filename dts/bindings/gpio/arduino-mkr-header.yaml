    GPIO pins exposing on Arduino MKR headers.

    The Arduino MKR layout provides two headers on both edges of the board.

    * One side of the 14-pin header is analog inputs and digital signals.
      A1 to A6 is Analog input. The outside pin is AREF.
      A0 that is next to AREF used as a DAC output pin too.
      D0-D5 is a digital output.
    * The other side 14-pin header is power supplies and peripheral interface.
      There are 5V and VCC power supply, GND, and RESET pin. UART, I2C,
      and SPI peripheral pins are also there. The end 2 pins are simple GPIO pins.

    This binding provides a nexus mapping for 22 pins where parent pins 0
    through 14 correspond to D0 through D21, and parent pins 15 through 21
    correspond to A0 through A6, as depicted below.

        -  AREF                 5V       -
        15 A0/D15/DAC0          VIN      -
        16 A1/D16               VCC      -
        17 A2/D17               GND      -
        18 A3/D18               RESET    -
        19 A4/D19               D14/TX   14
        20 A5/D20               D13/RX   13
        21 A6/D21               D12/SCL  12
        0  D0                   D11/SDA  11
        1  D1                   D10/CPIO 10
        2  D2                   D9/SCK   9
        3  D3                   D8/COPI  8
        4  D4                   D7       7
        5  D5                   D6       6
