  Renesas RA ACMPHS (High-Speed Analog COMParator) Controller

  The following example displays the minimum node layout:

    acmphs_global: acmphs_global@deadbeef {
            ...

            acmphs0: acmphs0 {
                    compatible = "renesas,ra-acmphs";
                    channel = <0>;
                    status = "disabled";
            };
    };

  Enabling the comparator controller node requires setting the minimum
  default configuration of the comparator. This includes selecting the
  positive and negative inputs, and routing them using pinctrl:

  Note: A set of pinctrl for the default comparator controller node is
  already defined on each board that supported comparator. Please check
  the boardâ€™s pinctrl before defining it.

  &pinctrl {
          acmphs_ivref0: acmphs_ivref0 {
                  group1 {
                          /* IVREF0 */
                          psels = <RA_PSEL(RA_PSEL_ACMPHS, ..., ...)>;
                          renesas,analog-enable;
                  };
          };

          acmphs0_ivcmp0: acmphs0_ivcmp0 {
                  group1 {
                          /* CH0 IVCMP0 */
                          psels = <RA_PSEL(RA_PSEL_ACMPHS, ..., ...)>;
                          renesas,analog-enable;
                  };
          };
  };

  &acmphs_global {
          status = "okay";

          acmphs0 {
                  pinctrl-0 = <&acmphs_ivref0 &acmphs0_ivcmp0>;
                  pinctrl-names = "default";
                  interrupts = <90 12>;
                  interrupt-names = "hs";
                  reference-input-source = "ivref0";
                  compare-input-source = "ivcmp0";
                  status = "okay";
          };

properties:
  channel:
    type: int
    required: true

  interrupts:
    description: |
      IRQ number and priority to use for interrupt Comparator:
      - "hs": generated on valid edge detection from comparison result
      Note: when this interrupts property is not defined, none of the trigger APIs
            can be used (set_trigger, set_trigger_callback, trigger_is_pending).

  reference-input-source:
    type: string
    required: true
    enum:
      - "ivref0"
      - "ivref1"
      - "ivref2"
      - "ivref3"
    description: |
      Select the Analog reference voltage source.
      Note: ivref2 is connected to Vref
            ivref3 is connected to DA0 (DAC)
            If either of these is selected, there is no need to configure pinsel for pinctrl.

  compare-input-source:
    type: string
    required: true
    enum:
      - "ivcmp0"
      - "ivcmp1"
      - "ivcmp2"
      - "ivcmp3"
    description: |
      Select the Analog compare voltage source.
      Note: ivcmp1 is connected to DA0 (DAC)
            If ivcmp1 is selected, there is no need to configure pinsel for pinctrl.

  noise-filter:
    type: int
    enum: [1, 8, 16, 32]
    default: 32
    description: |
      Select the PCLK divisor for the hardware digital debounce filter.
      Larger divisors provide a longer debounce and take longer for the output to update.

  output-invert-polarity:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      When enabled comparator output is inverted.

  pin-output-enable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Turn this on to enable the CMPOUTn signal for this channel.
      The CMPOUTn signal for each channel is OR'd together and the result is output to VCOUT.
