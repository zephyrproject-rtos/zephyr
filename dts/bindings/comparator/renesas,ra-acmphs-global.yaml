  Renesas RA ACMPHS (High-Speed Analog COMParator) Global

  The following example displays the minimum node layout:

    acmphs_global: acmphs_global@deadbeef {
            compatible = "renesas,ra-acmphs-global";
            reg = <0xdeadbeef 0x200>;
            status = "disabled";

            acmphs0: acmphs0 {
                    ...
            };
    };

  If the pin-output-enable is selected in the comparator controller node,
  this global node needs to define the VCOUT pin to enable output on that pin.

  Note: The VCOUT pinctrl for the comparator global node is already defined
  on each board that supported comparator. Please check the boardâ€™s pinctrl
  before defining it.

    acmphs_vcout: acmphs_vcout {
            group1 {
                    /* VCOUT */
                    psels = <RA_PSEL(RA_PSEL_ACMPHS_VCOUT, ..., ...)>;
            };
    };

    &acmphs_global {
            pinctrl-0 = <&acmphs_vcout>;
            pinctrl-names = "default";
            status = "okay";

            acmphs0 {
                    ...
            };
    };

  Note: There is only one VCOUT shared across all comparator controller nodes.
  Therefore, the VCOUT value is the logical OR of the output signals from all
  comparator controllers that have pin-output-enable enabled.
