title: Microchip G1 Analog Comparator

description: |
  Binding for the Microchip Comparator driver supporting AC G1 peripherals.

compatible: "microchip,ac-g1-comparator"

include:
  - name: base.yaml
  - name: pinctrl-device.yaml

properties:
  reg:
    required: true
    description: |
      Base address of AC peripheral and its size

  comparator-channel:
    required: true
    type: int
    enum: [0, 1]
    description: |
      Comparator channel index (0 or 1).

  single-shot-mode:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable single-shot mode operation. When enabled, the comparator performs a single comparison
      and disables itself. This must be disabled for continuous-mode features like hysteresis.

  positive-mux-input:
    type: string
    enum: ["pin0", "pin1", "pin2", "pin3", "vscale"]
    description: |
      Positive input source selection (MUXPOS):
        - pin0:   I/O pin 0 (0x0)
        - pin1:   I/O pin 1 (0x1)
        - pin2:   I/O pin 2 (0x2)
        - pin3:   I/O pin 3 (0x3)
        - vscale: VDDANA scaler (0x4)

  negative-mux-input:
    type: string
    enum: ["pin0", "pin1", "pin2", "pin3", "gnd", "vscale", "bandgap", "dac"]
    description: |
      Negative input source selection (MUXNEG):
        - pin0:    I/O pin 0 (0x0)
        - pin1:    I/O pin 1 (0x1)
        - pin2:    I/O pin 2 (0x2)
        - pin3:    I/O pin 3 (0x3)
        - gnd:     Ground (0x4)
        - vscale:  VDDANA scaler (0x5)
        - bandgap: Internal bandgap voltage (0x6)
        - dac:     DAC output (0x7)

  vddana-scale-value:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      VSCALE = (VDDANA * (value + 1)) / 64
      Only used when either positive or negative input is configured as "vscale".
      Valid range: 0 to 63

  output-mode:
    type: string
    enum: ["off", "async", "sync"]
    default: "off"
    description: |
      Comparator output routing mode:
        - off:   Output is not routed to COMPn I/O pin (0x0)
        - async: Asynchronous output is routed (0x1)
        - sync:  Synchronous filtered output is routed (0x2)

  run-standby:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Keep the comparator running in standby mode (when the core is sleeping).

  hysteresis-enable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable hysteresis on comparator output.
      This is only valid when single-shot mode is disabled (i.e., in continuous mode).

  hysteresis-level:
    type: string
    enum: ["hyst50", "hyst100", "hyst150"]
    default: "hyst50"
    description: |
      Hysteresis voltage level to apply when hysteresis is enabled:
        - hyst50:  50 mV (0x0)
        - hyst100: 100 mV (0x1)
        - hyst150: 150 mV (0x2)

      This setting is effective only if hysteresis is enabled and single-shot mode is disabled.

  filter-length:
    type: string
    enum: ["off", "maj3", "maj5"]
    default: "off"
    description: |
      Output filtering (debounce) mode:
        - off:   No filtering (0x0)
        - maj3:  3-bit majority filter (2 of 3) (0x1)
        - maj5:  5-bit majority filter (3 of 5) (0x2)

  swap-inputs:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Swap the comparator inputs and invert the output:
        - false: MUXPOS → positive input, MUXNEG → negative input
        - true:  MUXNEG → positive input, MUXPOS → negative input (output inverted)

      This can be used for offset cancellation.
      It must be configured before enabling the comparator.

  event-input-enable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable the event input path for the comparator.

  event-output-enable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable the event output path for the comparator.
