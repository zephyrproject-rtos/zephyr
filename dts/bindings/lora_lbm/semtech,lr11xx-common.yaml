    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      GPIO connected to the radio's BUSY/DIO0.

      This signal is high when the radio is ready to accept commands, and
      low when it is processing a command.

    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      GPIO connected to the radio's LR_EVENT/DIO9.

      This signal is high to indicate an event is available on the radio. It
      becomes low when all events are cleared.

    type: int
    description: |

      If a switch is selected here, it will be low by default and high when a
      rf mode using it is entered.
      If a switch is not selected here, it will always be left in High-Z state.
