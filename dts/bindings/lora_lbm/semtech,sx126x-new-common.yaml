description: Semtech SX126X LoRa radio module

include: spi-device.yaml

properties:
  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      GPIO connected to the radio's NRESET signal.

      This signal is open-drain, active-low as interpreted by the modem.

  busy-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      GPIO connected to the radio's BUSY signal.

      This signal is high when the radio is ready to accept commands, and
      low when it is processing a command.


  dio1-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      GPIO connected to the radio's DIO1 signal. This GPIO will be used as
      a generic IRQ line from the chip.

  dio2-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      GPIO connected to the radio's DIO2 signal. This GPIO will be used as
      a generic IRQ line from the chip.

      Note that this conflicts with dio2-as-rf-switch.

  dio2-as-rf-switch:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Use DIO2 to drive an RF switch selecting between the TX and RX paths.

      When enabled, DIO2 goes high when the chip is transmitting.
      Note that this conflicts with dio2-gpios.

  dio3-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      GPIO connected to the radio's DIO3 signal. This GPIO will be used as
      a generic IRQ line from the chip.

      Note that this conflicts with dio3-as-tcxo-enable.

  dio3-as-tcxo-control:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Use DIO3 to control a TCXO.

      When enabled, DIO3 supplies power to a TCXO when needed. Its voltage is
      controlled by tcxo-voltage.
      Note that this conflicts with dio3-gpios.

  tcxo-voltage:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Supply voltage on the radio's DIO3, if set as TCXO control.

      See constants SX126X_TCXO_SUPPLY_* in dt-bindings/lora_lbm/sx126x.h.

  tcxo-wakeup-time:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      In milliseconds, the wakeup (or stabilization) time of the TCXO used
      by the radio.

      Set this value to 0 to disable the TCXO management feature.

  xtal-capacitor-value-xta:
    type: int
    description: |
      Internal trimming capacitor value on the radio's XTA pin as register value.

      Values from 0x00 to 0x2F code a capacitance from 11.3pF to 33.4pF, in
      approximative 0.47pF steps, as described in section 4.1.3 of the datasheet.

      Values over 0x2F are not supported. Ignored when a TCXO is configured.

  xtal-capacitor-value-xtb:
    type: int
    description: |
      Internal trimming capacitor value on the radio's XTB pin as register value.

      Values from 0x00 to 0x2F code a capacitance from 11.3pF to 33.4pF, in
      approximative 0.47pF steps, as described in section 4.1.3 of the datasheet.

      Values over 0x2F are not supported. Ignored when a TCXO is configured.

  reg-mode:
    type: int
    required: true
    enum:
      - 0
      - 1
    description: |
      Configuration of the radio's power regulator mode.

      See constants SX126X_REG_MODE_* in dt-bindings/lora_lbm/sx126x.h

  rx-boosted:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Sets the radio in RX Boosted mode, allowing a ~2dB increased sensitivity,
      at the expense of a ~2mA higher current consumption in RX mode.

  tx-power-offset:
    type: int
    description: |
      Default board-specific TX Power offset in dB. Defaults to 0.

      Can be reconfigured at runtime via radio_utilities_set_tx_power_offset.
