    The Renesas RZ/N2L pin controller is a node responsible for controlling
    pin function selection and pin properties, such as routing the TX and RX of UART0
    to pin 5 and pin 6 of port 16.

    The node has the 'pinctrl' node label set in your SoC's devicetree,
    so you can modify it like this:

      &pinctrl {
              /* your modifications go here */
      };

    All device pin configurations should be placed in child nodes of the
    'pinctrl' node, as shown in this example:

      /* You can put this in places like a board-pinctrl.dtsi file in
       * your board directory, or a devicetree overlay in your application.
       */

      /* include pre-defined combinations for the SoC variant used by the board */
      #include <zephyr/dt-bindings/pinctrl/renesas/pinctrl-rzn-common.h>

      &pinctrl {
        uart0_pins: uart0 {
          group1 {
            pinmux = <RZN_PINMUX(PORT_16, 5, 1)>; /* TXD */
          };
          group2 {
            pinmux = <RZN_PINMUX(PORT_16, 6, 2)>; /* RXD */
            input-enable;
          };
        };
      };

    The 'uart0_pins' child node encodes the pin configurations for a
    particular state of a device; in this case, the default (that is, active)
    state.

    As shown, pin configurations are organized in groups within each child node.
    Each group can specify a list of pin function selections in the 'pinmux'
    property.

    A group can also specify shared pin properties common to all the specified
    pins, such as the 'input-enable' property in group 2.
