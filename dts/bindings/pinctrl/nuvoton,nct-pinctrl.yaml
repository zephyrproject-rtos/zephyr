  The Nuvoton pin controller is a singleton node responsible for controlling
  pin function selection and pin properties. For example, you can use these
  nodes to select peripheral pin functions.

  Here is a list of supported standard pin properties:
    - bias-pull-down: Enable pull-down resistor.
    - bias-pull-up: Enable pull-up resistor.

  Custom pin properties for nct series are available also:
    - pinmux-gpio: Inverse pinmux back to gpio

  An example for NCT6 family, include the chip level pinctrl DTSI file in the
  board level DTS:

    #include <nuvoton/nct/nct6/nct6-pinctrl.dtsi>

  We want to use the I2C0_0 port of the NCT6694B controller and enable the
  internal 3.3V pull-up if its i2c frequency won't exceed 400kHz.

  To change a pin's pinctrl default properties, add a reference to the
  pin in the board's DTS file and set the properties as below:

    &i2c0_0_sda_scl_gpb4_b5 {
      bias-pull-up; /* Enable internal pull-up for i2c0_0 */
      pinmux-locked; /* Lock pinmuxing */
    };

    &i2c0_0 {
      pinctrl-0 = <&i2c0_0_sda_scl_gpb4_b5>;
      pinctrl-names = "default";
    }
