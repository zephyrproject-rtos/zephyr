  STM32 pin controller with "I/O synchronization"

  Identical to the "regular" pin controller with "st,stm32-pinctrl" compatible,
  with an additional "I/O synchronization" feature. This feature allows addition
  of a programmable delay to the signal input or output path ("I/O delay"), and
  synchronization of GPIO data with configuration clock edge(s) ("I/O retime").

  This pin controller can be found on STM32N6 series.

compatible: "st,stm32n6-pinctrl"

        Clock edges on which input/output should be retimed

        If this property is present, I/O retiming is enabled,
        and this property selects whether the input/output data
        is retimed on rising, falling or both edges of clock.

        If this property is not present, I/O retiming is disabled.
      enum:
        - "rising"
        - "falling"
        - "both"

    st,io-delay-ps:
      type: int
      default: 0
      description: |
        Delay applied to input or output path (in picoseconds)

        The default value matches hardware default, and allows to keep
        the property unspecified on most pinctrl nodes which do not use
        the I/O delay feature.
      enum:
        - 0
        - 300
        - 500

    st,io-delay-path:

      description: |
        Direction in which the I/O delay should be applied

        The default value corresponds to hardware default.
