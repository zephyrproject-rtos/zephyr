  Synopsys ARC EMSDP board Pin controller for Pmod and Arduino shield interface.

  Device pin configuration should be placed in the child nodes of this node.
  Populate the 'pinmux' field with a pair consisting of a pin number and its IO
  function.

  For example, setting PmodA to SPI would look like this:

    #include <zephyr/dt-bindings/pinctrl/emsdp-pinctrl.h>

    &pinctrl {
      pmodA_spi1_cs0: pmodA_spi1_cs0 {
        pinmux = <PMOD_A PMOD_SPI>;
      };
    };

compatible: "snps,emsdp-pinctrl"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  reg:
    required: true
