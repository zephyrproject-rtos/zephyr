  NXP S32 Pin Controller for S32Z/E SoCs

  The NXP S32 pin controller is a singleton node responsible for controlling
  the pin function selection and pin properties. This node, labeled 'pinctrl' in
  the SoC's devicetree, will define pin configurations in pin groups. Each group
  within the pin configuration defines the pin configuration for a peripheral,
  and each numbered subgroup in the pin group defines all the pins for that
  peripheral with the same configuration properties. The 'pinmux' property in
  a group selects the pins to be configured, and the remaining properties set
  configuration values for those pins.

  For example, to configure the pinmux for UART0, modify the 'pinctrl' from your
  board or application devicetree overlay as follows:

    /* Include the SoC package header containing the predefined pins definitions */
    #include <nxp/s32/S32Z27-BGA594-pinctrl.h>

    &pinctrl {
      uart0_default: uart0_default {
        group1 {
          pinmux = <PB10_LIN_0_TX>;
          output-enable;
        };
        group2 {
          pinmux = <PB11_LIN_0_RX>;
          input-enable;
        };
      };
    };

  The 'uart0_default' node contains the pin configurations for a particular state
  of a device. The 'default' state is the active state. Other states for the same
  device can be specified in separate child nodes of 'pinctrl'.

  In addition to 'pinmux' property, each group can contain other properties such as
  'bias-pull-up' or 'slew-rate' that will be applied to all the pins defined in
  'pinmux' array. To enable the input buffer use 'input-enable' and to enable the
  output buffer use 'output-enable'.

  To link the pin configurations with UART0 device, use pinctrl-N property in the
  device node, where 'N' is the zero-based state index (0 is the default state).
  Following previous example:

    &uart0 {
      pinctrl-0 = <&uart0_default>;
      pinctrl-names = "default";
      status = "okay";
    };

  If only the required properties are supplied, the pin configuration register
  will be assigned the following reset values:
    - input and output buffers disabled
    - internal pull not enabled
    - open drain disabled
    - slew rate 4 (see description in property below).
    - termination resistor disabled (affect LVDS pads only).
    - current reference control disabled (affect LVDS pads only).
    - Rx current boost disabled  (affect LVDS pads only).

  Additionally:
  - Safe Mode is always kept as reset value (disabled).
  - Receiver Select is always kept as reset value (enables the differential vref based receiver).
