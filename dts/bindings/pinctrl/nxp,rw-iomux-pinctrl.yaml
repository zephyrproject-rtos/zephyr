  RW61x pin control node. This node defines pin configurations in pin
  groups, and has the 'pinctrl' node identifier in the SOC's devicetree. Each
  group within the pin configuration defines a peripheral's pin configuration.
  Each numbered subgroup represents pins with shared configuration for that
  peripheral. The 'pinmux' property of each group selects the pins to be
  configured with these properties. For example, here is a configuration
  for FLEXCOMM0 pins:

  pinmux_flexcomm0_usart: pinmux_flexcomm0_usart {
    group0 {
      pinmux = <IO_MUX_FC0_USART_DATA_IO2>,
              <IO_MUX_FC0_USART_DATA_IO3>;
      slew-rate = "normal";
    };
  };

  If only the required properties are supplied, the pin will be configured
  as normal drive strength and no pull. This corresponds to the following
  pin settings:
  PAD_PU_PD_ENx = (0x0 << pin_index)
  SR_CONFIGx = (0x2 << pin_index)

  Note

  Note the inherited pinctrl properties defined below have the following effects:
  bias-pull-up: PAD_PU_PD_ENx= (0x1 << pin_index)
  bias-pull-down: PAD_PU_PD_ENx= (0x10 << pin_index)

          Pin output slew rate. Sets the GPIOxx_SR field in the SR_CONFIGx
          register.
          0 - slow slew rate
          1 - normal slew rate
          2 - fast slew rate
          3 - fastest slew rate (ultra)
