  The Nuvoton pin controller is a singleton node responsible for controlling
  pin function selection and pin properties. For example, you can use these
  nodes to select peripheral pin functions.

  Here is a list of supported standard pin properties:
    - bias-pull-down: Enable pull-down resistor.
    - bias-pull-up: Enable pull-up resistor.

  An example for the NPCM4 family, include the chip-level pinctrl DTSI file in the
  board-level DTS:

    #include <nuvoton/npcm/npcm4/npcm4-pincfg-default.dtsi>

  We want to use the I2C0_0 port of the NPCM400F controller and enable the
  internal 3.3V pull-up if its I2C frequency won't exceed 400kHz.

  To change a pin's pinctrl default properties, add a reference to the pin in
  the board's DTS file and set the properties in the child node of pinctrl as below:

    i2c1a_scl_sda_gpio60_61: periph-i2c1a {
      scl {
        pinmux = <GPIO60__RSTOUT2__SCL1A 2>;  /* Set the pinmux to SCL1A */
        nuvoton,voltage-level-mv = <3300>;    /* Set the voltage level to 3.3V */
        bias-pull-up;                         /* Enable internal pull-up for i2c0_0 */
      };
      sda {
        pinmux = <GPIO61__RSTOUT1__SDA1A 2>;  /* Set the pinmux to SDA1A */
        nuvoton,voltage-level-mv = <3300>;    /* Set the voltage level to 3.3V */
      };
    };

    &i2c0_0 {
      pinctrl-0 = <&i2c1a_scl_sda_gpio60_61>;
      pinctrl-names = "default";
    };

    The pin definition is defined in the pin definition node in the chip-level pinctrl DTSI
    file:

      #include <nuvoton/npcm/npcm4/npcm4-pincfg-default.dtsi>

    The pin definition node is responsible for setting up pin alternate functions with
    configurations of registers. This includes defining the alternate pin registers and their
    bits, as well as the configurations of the pull-up/down and the voltage output level. The
    example below shows the pin definition for the GPIO60 / RSTOUT2 / SCL1A pin:

      gpio60__rstout2__scl1a: pin_gpio60__rstout2__scl1a {
        nuvoton,pin-hw-def;
        nuvoton,pin-reg = <NPCM_PINCTRL_ALT5D_2_ACPI_GPIO60_SEL
            NPCM_PINCTRL_ALTA_0_SMB1A_SL
            NPCM_PIN_REG_NULL
            NPCM_PIN_REG_NULL
            NPCM_PIN_REG_NULL>;
        nuvoton,alt = <0x10 0 0x18 NPCM_PIN_CFG_NULL NPCM_PIN_CFG_NULL NPCM_PIN_CFG_NULL>;
        nuvoton,low-voltage-reg = <NPCM_PINCTRL_LV_CTL1_0_SCL1A_LV>;
        nuvoton,low-voltage-def-mv = <1800>;
        nuvoton,low-voltage-sup = <0x5>;
        nuvoton,pull-up-down-reg = <NPCM_PINCTRL_DEVPU0_0_SMB1A_PUE>;
        bias-pull-up;
        nuvoton,pull-up-down-sup = <0x4>;
        nuvoton,id = <GPIO60__RSTOUT2__SCL1A>;
      };

      Here, the standard pin properties bias-pull-up / bias-pull-down in the pin
      definition node are represented as the default peripheral pull-up in hardware of
      supported alt functions.
