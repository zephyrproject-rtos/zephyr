    EM32 Pin controller.

    Based on pincfg-node.yaml binding.

    Note: `bias-disable` and `drive-push-pull` are default pin configurations.
           They will be applied in case no `bias-foo` or `driver-bar` properties
           are set.

        Integer represents gpio pin number and mux setting.
        Each integer encodes a port, line and alternate function.
        With:
        - port: The gpio port index (PA = 0, PB = 1)
        - line: The line offset within the port (PA0 = 0, PA1 = 1)
        - function: The function number, can be:
        * 0 : Alternate Function 0
        * 1 : Alternate Function 1
        * 2 : Alternate Function 2
        * ...
        * 15 : Alternate Function 15
        * 16 : Analog
        * 17 : GPIO
        In case selected pin function is GPIO, pin is statically configured as
        a plain input/output GPIO. Default configuration is input. Output value
        can be configured by adding 'output-low' or 'output-high' properties
        to the pin configuration.

        To simplify the usage, macro is available to generate "pinmux" field.
        This macro is available here:
          -include/zephyr/dt-bindings/pinctrl/em32f967-pinctrl.h

        - "medium-speed"
        - "high-speed"
        - "very-high-speed"
