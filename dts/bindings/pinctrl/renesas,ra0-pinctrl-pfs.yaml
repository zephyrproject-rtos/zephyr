title: Renesas RA0 Pin Controller

description: |
    Node responsible for controlling pin function selection and pin properties,
    such as routing a TXD0_A to P101.

    The node has the 'pinctrl' node label set in your SoC's devicetree,
    so you can modify it like this:

      &pinctrl {
              /* your modifications go here */
      };

    All device pin configurations should be placed in child nodes of the
    'pinctrl' node, as shown in this example:

      /* You can put this in places like a board-pinctrl.dtsi file in
       * your board directory, or a devicetree overlay in your application.
       */

      /* include pre-defined combinations for the SoC variant used by the board */
      #include <zephyr/dt-bindings/pinctrl/renesas/pinctrl-ra0.h>

      &pinctrl {
        /* configuration for the uart0 "default" state */
        uart0_default: uart0_default {
          group1 {
            psels = <RA_PSEL(RA_PSEL_P1nPFS_TXD0A, 1, 1)>;  /* tx */
            output-enable;
          };

          group2 {
            psels = <RA_PSEL(RA_PSEL_P1nPFS_RXD0A, 1, 0)>;  /* rx */
          };
        };
      };

    The 'uart0_default' child node encodes the pin configurations for a
    particular state of a device; in this case, the default (that is, active)
    state.

    As shown, pin configurations are organized in groups within each child node.
    Each group can specify a list of pin function selections in the 'psels'
    property.

    A group can also specify shared pin properties common to all the specified
    pins, such as the 'output-enable' property in group 1. Here is a list of
    supported standard pin properties:

    - bias-pull-up: Enable pull-up resistor.
    - input-enable: Enable input from the pin.
    - drive-open-drain: Drive with open drain
    - output-enable: Enable output on a pin without actively driving it
    - output-high: Set the pin to output mode with high level

    To link pin configurations with a device, use a pinctrl-N property for some
    number N, like this example you could place in your board's DTS file:

       #include "board-pinctrl.dtsi"

       &sci0 {
             pinctrl-0 = <&uart0_default>;
             pinctrl-1 = <&uart0_sleep>;
             pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
       };
