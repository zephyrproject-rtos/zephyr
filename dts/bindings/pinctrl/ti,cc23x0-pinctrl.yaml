    TI SimpleLink CC23X0 Pin Controller

    Device pin configuration should be placed in the child nodes of this node.
    Populate the 'pinmux' field with a pair consisting of a pin number and its IO
    functions.

    The node has the 'pinctrl' node label set in your SoC's devicetree,
    so you can modify it like this:

      &pinctrl {
              /* your modifications go here */
      };

    All device pin configurations should be placed in child nodes of the
    'pinctrl' node, as in the i2c0 example shown at the end.

    Here is a list of
    supported standard pin properties:

    - bias-disable: Disable pull-up/down.
    - bias-pull-down: Enable pull-down resistor.
    - bias-pull-up: Enable pull-up resistor.
    - drive-open-drain: Output driver is open-drain.
    - drive-open-source: Output driver is open-source.
    - input-enable: enable input.
    - input-schmitt-enable: enable input schmitt circuit.
