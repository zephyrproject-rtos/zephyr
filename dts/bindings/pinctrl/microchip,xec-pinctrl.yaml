    Microchip XEC Pin Controller

    Based on pincfg-node.yaml binding.
    The MCHP XEC pin controller is a singleton node responsible for controlling
    pin function selection and pin properties. For example, you can use this
    node to select peripheral pin functions.

    The node has the 'pinctrl' node label set in your SoC's devicetree,
    so you can modify it like this:

      &pinctrl {
              /* your modifications go here */
      };

    All device pin configurations should be placed in child nodes of the
    'pinctrl' node, as in the spi0 example shown at the end:

    A group can also specify shared pin properties common to all the specified
    pins, such as the 'bias-pull-up' property in group 2. Here is a list of
    supported standard pin properties:

    - bias-disable: Disable pull-up/down (default behavior, not required).
    - bias-pull-down: Enable pull-down resistor.
    - bias-pull-up: Enable pull-up resistor.
    - drive-push-pull: Output driver is push-pull (default, not required).
    - drive-open-drain: Output driver is open-drain.
    - output-high: Set output state high when pin configured.
    - output-low: Set output state low when pin configured.

    Custom pin properties for drive strength and slew rate are available:
    - drive-strength
    - slew-rate

    Driver strength and slew rate hardware defaults vary by SoC and pin.

    An example for MEC172x family, include the chip level pinctrl
    DTSI file in the board level DTS:

      #include <microchip/mec172x/mec172xnsz-pinctrl.dtsi>

    We want to use the shared SPI port of the MEC172x QMSPI controller
    and want the chip select 0 to be open-drain.

    To change a pin's pinctrl default properties add a reference to the
    pin in the board's DTS file and set the properties.

      &spi0 {
        pinctrl-0 = < &shd_cs0_n_gpio055
                      &shd_clk_gpio056
                      &shd_io0_gpio223
                      &shd_io1_gpio224
                      &shd_io3_gpio016 >;
        pinctrl-names = "default";
      }

      &shd_cs0_n_gpio055 {
        drive-open-drain;
      };
