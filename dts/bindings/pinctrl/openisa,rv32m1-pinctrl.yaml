  OpenISA RV32M1 Pin Controller

  This node will define pin configurations in pin groups,
  and has the 'pinctrl' node identifier in the SOC's devicetree. Each group
  within the pin configuration defines the pin configuration for a peripheral,
  and each numbered subgroup in the pin group defines all the pins for that
  peripheral with the same configuration properties. The 'pins' property in
  a group selects the pins to be configured, and the remaining properties set
  configuration values for those pins. Here is an example group for UART0 pins:

  uart0_default: uart0_default {
    group0 {
      pinmux = <RV32M1_MUX('C', 7, 3)>,
               <RV32M1_MUX('C', 8, 3)>;
      drive-strength = "low";
      slew-rate = "fast";
    };
  };

  If only the required properties are supplied, the pin configuration register
  will be assigned the following values:
  PCR_PS=0,
  PCR_PE=0,
  PCR_ODE=0,
  PCR_SRE=<slew-rate selection>,
  PCR_PFE=0
