    TI MSPM0 pinctrl node.

    Device pin configuration should be placed in the child nodes of this node.
    Populate the 'pinmux' field with a pair consisting of a pin number and its
    IO functions.

    The node has the 'pinctrl' node label set in your SoC's devicetree,
    so you can modify it like this:

      &pinctrl {
              /* your modifications go here */
      };

    All device pin configurations should be placed in child nodes of the
    'pinctrl' node, as in the i2c0 example shown at the end.

    Here is a list of
    supported standard pin properties:

    - bias-disable: Disable pull-up/down.
    - bias-pull-down: Enable pull-down resistor.
    - bias-pull-up: Enable pull-up resistor.
    - drive-open-drain: Output driver is open-drain.
    - drive-open-drain: Output driver is open-source.
    - drive-strength: Maximum current that can be sourced from the pin.
    - input-enable: enable input.
    - ti,invert: enable logical inversion of a digital input or output
    - ti,hysteresis: enable hysteresis control on open-drain pins

    An example for MSPM0 family, include the chip level pinctrl
    DTSI file in the board level DTS:

      #include <dt-bindings/pinctrl/mspm0-pinctrl.h>

    We want to configure the I2C pins to open drain, with pullup enabled
    and input enabled.

    To change a pin's pinctrl default properties add a reference to the
    pin in the board's DTS file or in the project overlay and set the
    properties.

      &i2c1 {
        pinctrl-0 = <&i2c1_scl_pb2_pull_up &i2c1_sda_pb3_pull_up>;
        pinctrl-names = "default";
      }

    The i2c1_scl_pb2_pull_up corresponds to the following pin configuration in
    the board dts file:

      &pinctrl {
        i2c1_scl_pb2_pull_up: i2c1_scl_pb2_pull_up {
          pinmux = <MSP_PINMUX(15,MSPM0_PIN_FUNCTION_4)>;
          input-enable;
          bias-pull-up;
          drive-open-drain;
        };
      };

    Pin pb2 refers to the device pin name that one would see printed on the
    launchpad, and the number 15 in the pinmux define refers to the PINCMx.

    These are obtained from the device-specific datasheet.
