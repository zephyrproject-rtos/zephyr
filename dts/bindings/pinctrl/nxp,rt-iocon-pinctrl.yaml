  RT600/RT500 Pin Controller

  This node defines pin configurations in pin
  groups, and has the 'pinctrl' node identifier in the SOC's devicetree. Each
  group within the pin configuration defines a peripheral's pin configuration.
  Each numbered subgroup represents pins with shared configuration for that
  peripheral. The 'pinmux' property of each group selects the pins to be
  configured with these properties. For example, here is a configuration
  for FLEXCOMM0 pins:

  pinmux_flexcomm0_usart: pinmux_flexcomm0_usart {
    group0 {
      pinmux = <FC0_TXD_SCL_MISO_WS_PIO0_1>,
              <FC0_RXD_SDA_MOSI_DATA_PIO0_2>;
      slew-rate = "normal";
      drive-strength = "normal";
    };
  };

  If only the required properties are supplied, the ICON_PIO register will
  be assigned the following values:
  IOCON_FUNC=<pin mux selection>,
  IOCON_PUPDENA = 0,
  IOCON_PUPDSEL = 0,
  IOCON_IBENA = 0,
  IOCON_SLEWRATE = <slew-rate selection>,
  IOCON_FULLDRIVE = <drive-strength selection>,
  IOCON_AMENA = 0,
  IOCON_ODENA = 0,
  IOCON_IIENA = 0,

  Note the inherited pinctrl properties defined below have the following effects:
  drive-open-drain: IOCON_ODENA=1
  bias-pull-up: IOCON_PUPDENA=1, IOCON_PUPSEL=1
  bias-pull-down: IOCON_PUPDENA=1, IOCON_PUPSEL=0
  input-enable: IOCON_IBENA=1
