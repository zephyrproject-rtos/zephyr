  i.MX IOMUXC

  The specifier space "pinmux" of this binding should have two cells describing
  the resources needed from the GPR registers.
  For each specifier, the first cell should be the offset of the GPR register in bytes
  from the base address of the GPR device base address. The second cell should be a
  bitmask indicating which bits in the specified register are relevant to the referencing device.
