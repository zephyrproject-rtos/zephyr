  Realtek Ameba pinctrl is a singleton node responsible for controlling pin function selection
  and pin properties. For example, you can use this node to route UART0 TX to pin PB_17
  and enable the pull-up resistor on the pin.

  All device pin configurations should be placed in child nodes of the 'pinctrl' node,
  as shown in this example:
    /* put this example in places like a board-pinctrl.dtsi file in your board directory,
     * or a devicetree overlay in your application.
     */
    &pinctrl {
      /* configuration for uart0 device, default state */
      uart0_default: uart0_default {
        /* 'group1' name is arbitrary, if pin's settings are not same,
         * add other group like group2 {}
         */
        group1 {
          pinmux = <AMEBA_PINMUX('B', 17, AMEBA_UART2_TXD)>,
                   <AMEBA_PINMUX('B', 18, AMEBA_UART2_RXD)>;
          bias-pull-up;
        };
      };
    };

  The 'uart0_default' child node encodes the pin configurations for a particular state of a device;
  in this case, the default (that is, active) state. You would specify the low-power configuration
  for the same device in a separate child node.

  As shown, pin configurations are organized in groups within each child node. Each group can
  specify a list of pin function selections in the 'pinmux' property. The AMEBA_PINMUX macro is
  used to specify a pin function selection and pin configuration. You could choose pinmux specified
  function to specified pin. And you could configure driver direction, driver state and pull state
  for the specified pad.

  To link this pin configuration with a device, use a pinctrl-N property for some number N,
  like this example you could place in your board's DTS file:
    &uart0 {
      pinctrl-0 = <&uart0_default>;
      pinctrl-names = "default";
    };
