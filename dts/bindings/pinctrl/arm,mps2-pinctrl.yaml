    The Arm Mps2 pin controller is a node responsible for controlling
    pin function selection and pin properties, such as routing a UART3 TX
    to pin 1.

    The node has the 'pinctrl' node label set in your SoC's devicetree,
    so you can modify it like this:

      &pinctrl {
              /* your modifications go here */
      };

    All device pin configurations should be placed in child nodes of the
    'pinctrl' node, as shown in this example:

      &pinctrl {
        /* configuration for the usart0 "default" state */
        uart3_default: uart3_default {
          /* group 1 */
          group1 {
            /* configure P1 as UART3 TX */
            pinmux = <UART3_TXD_EXP>;
          };
          /* group 2 */
          group2 {
            /* configure P0 as UART3 RX */
            pinmux = <UART3_RXD_EXP>;
            /* enable input on pin 1 */
            input-enable;
          };
        };
      };

    The 'uart3_default' child node encodes the pin configurations for a
    particular state of a device; in this case, the default (that is, active)
    state.

    As shown, pin configurations are organized in groups within each child node.
    Each group can specify a list of pin function selections in the 'pinmux'
    property. Here is a list of supported standard pin properties:
    - input-enable

    A group can also specify shared pin properties common to all the specified
    pins, such as the 'input-enable' property in group 2.

    To link pin configurations with a device, use a pinctrl-N property for some
    number N, like this example you could place in your board's DTS file:

       #include "board-pinctrl.dtsi"

       &uart3 {
             pinctrl-0 = <&uart3_default>;
             pinctrl-1 = <&uart3_sleep>;
             pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
       };

          An array of pins sharing the same group properties. Each
          element of the array is an integer constructed from the
          pin number and the alternative function of the pin.
