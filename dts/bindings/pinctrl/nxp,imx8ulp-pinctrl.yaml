          Used to configure the pad's drive strength, which, together
          with the slew rate, affects the maximum frequency the pad's
          output buffer can yield. If "normal" drive strength is used,
          the maximum frequency will be lower as per the measurements
          found in the SoC datasheet. Note that the TRM refers to the
          "normal" drive strength as "standard". If unspecified, the
          default will be "normal".

        description: |
          Used to configure the pad's slew rate, which affects the
          maximum frequency the pad's output buffer can yield (
          "fast" slew rate -> higher pad frequency, "slow" slew rate ->
          lower pad frequency). Note that the TRM refers to the "fast"
          slew rate as "standard". If unspecified, the default will be
          "fast".
        enum:
          - "fast"
