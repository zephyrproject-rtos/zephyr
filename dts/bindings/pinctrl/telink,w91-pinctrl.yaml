    The Telink W91 pin controller is a singleton node responsible for
    controlling pin function selection and pin properties. For example, you can
    use this node to route UART2 TX to pin P16 and enable the pull-up resistor
    on the pin.

    The node has the 'pinctrl' node label set in your SoC's devicetree,
    so you can modify it like this:

      &pinctrl {
              /* your modifications go here */
      };

    All device pin configurations should be placed in child nodes of the
    'pinctrl' node, as shown in this example:

      /* You can put this in places like a board-pinctrl.dtsi file in
       * your board directory, or a devicetree overlay in your application.
       */

      /* include pre-defined pins and functions for the SoC used by the board */
      #include <dt-bindings/pinctrl/w91-pinctrl.h>

      &pinctrl {
        /* configuration for UART2 TX default state */
        uart2_tx_p15_default: uart2_tx_p15_default {
          /* configure P16 as W91_FUNC_UART_TXD */
          pinmux = ...
        };
        /* configuration for UART2 RX default state */
        uart2_rx_p15_default: uart2_rx_p15_default {
          /* configure P15 as W91_FUNC_UART_RXD */
          pinmux = ...
        };
      };

    The 'uart2_tx_p15_default' child node encodes the pin configurations
    for a particular state of a device; in this case, the default
    (that is, active) sate. You would specify the low-power configuration for
    the same device in a separate child node.

    A pin configuration can also specify pin properties such as the
    'bias-pull-up' property. Here is a list of supported standard pin
    properties:

    - bias-disable
    - bias-pull-down
    - bias-pull-up

    To link pin configurations with a device, use a pinctrl-N property for some
    number N, like this example you could place in your board's DTS file:

      #include "board-pinctrl.dtsi"

      &uart2 {
        pinctrl-0 = <&uart2_tx_p15_default &uart2_rx_p15_default>;
        pinctrl-names = "default";
      };

  pad-mul-sel:

        PinMux pad_mul_sel register value. Pin functions depend on it.

        For instance:
        Function C of P16 configs the pin to UART2_TX if pad_mul_sel is set to <1>.
        But, the same function configs the same pin to DAC_I_DAT2_I if pad_mul_sel is set to <0>.

        Refer to the Telink TLSR9 specs to get more information about pins configuration.
