  The Silabs SiWx91x pin controller is a devicetree node tasked with selecting
  the proper IO function for a given pin.

  The pinctrl settings are referenced in a device tree peripheral node. For
  example when configuring a UART:

    &ulpuart {
      pinctrl-0 = <&ulpuart_default>;
      pinctrl-names = "default";
    }

  pinctrl-0 is a phandle that stores the pin settings for the peripheral, in
  this example &ulpuart_default. This phandle is defined as a child node of the
  'pinctrl' node, typically in a board-pinctrl.dtsi file in the board directory
  or a device tree overlay in the application:

    &pinctrl {
      ulpuart_default: ulpuart_default {
        out {
          pinmux = <ULPUART_TX_ULP11>; /* Configure ULP pin 11 as ULPUART TX */
        };
        in {
          pinmux = <ULPUART_RX_ULP9>; /* Configure ULP pin 9 as ULPUART RX */
        };
      };
    };

  The 'ulpuart_default' child node encodes the pin configurations for a
  particular state of the device, the default (active) state.

  Pin configurations are organized in groups within each child node. The name
  given to groups is arbitrary. Each group can specify a list of pin function
  selections in the `pinmux` property, as well as a selection of pin properties
  as given by the rest of the properties on the group.
