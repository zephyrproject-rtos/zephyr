  LPC pinctrl node. This node defines pin configurations in pin groups, and has
  the 'pinctrl' node identifier in the SOC's devicetree. Each group within the
  pin configuration defines a peripheral's pin configuration. Each numbered
  subgroup represents pins with shared configuration for that peripheral. The
  'pinmux' property of each group selects the pins to be configured with these
  properties. For example, here is a configuration for FLEXCOMM0 pins:

  pinmux_flexcomm0_usart: pinmux_flexcomm0_usart {
    group0 {
      pinmux = <FC0_TXD_SCL_MISO_WS_PIO0_30>,
              <FC0_RXD_SDA_MOSI_DATA_PIO0_29>;
      slew-rate = "standard";
    };
  };

  If only the required properties are supplied, the ICON_PIO register will
  be assigned the following values:
  IOCON_FUNC=<pin mux selection>,
  IOCON_MODE=0,
  IOCON_SLEW=<slew-rate selection>,
  IOCON_INVERT=0,
  IOCON_DIGIMODE=1,
  IOCON_OD=0,

  Values for I2C type and analog type pins have the following defaults:
  IOCON_ASW=0
  IOCON_SSEL=0
  IOCON_FILTEROFF=1
  IOCON_ECS=0
  IOCON_EGP=1
  IOCON_I2CFILTER=1

  Note the inherited pinctrl properties defined below have the following effects:
  drive-open-drain: IOCON_OD=1
  bias-pull-up: IOCON_MODE=2
  bias-pull-down: IOCON_MODE=1
  drive-push-pull: IOCON_MODE=3

  Note: for the LPC11u6x, the following fields are also supported:
  IOCON_HYS- set by input-schmitt-enable
  IOCON_S_MODE- set by nxp,digital-filter
  IOCON_CLKDIV- set by nxp,filter-clock-div
  IOCON_FILTR- set by nxp,analog-filter

          Pin output slew rate. Sets the SLEW field in the IOCON register.
          defaults to standard slew rate, due to this being the reset value of
          the field.
          0 SLEW_0- standard mode, output slew rate is slower
          1 SLEW_1- fast mode, output slew rate is faster
