      In the context of a device node:

        Zephyr's use of the status property in the context of a device node
        deviates slightly from the semantics defined in the devicetree standard.

        Rather than representing an operational state, it configures application
        specific driver instantiation requirements: A value of "okay" indicates
        that a device driver SHALL be instantiated and initialized for this
        device at boot time, i.e. it is intended that the driver instance be
        "ready" at the time `main()` is called.

        A device driver can only be instantiated if exactly one driver is
        included in the build that binds to the compatible value of the device.
        This is usually done by setting a corresponding Kconfig variable like
        `CONFIG_ADC=y`.

        A value of "disabled" indicates that a device driver instance SHALL not
        be instantiated for this device. This is useful for devices that are not
        used by the application and for which no driver needs to be included in
        the build.

        Other values are included for compatibility with the devicetree
        specification but are not used by Zephyr.

      In the context of a non-device node:

        A value of "disabled" indicates that the configuration (including all
        subnodes) SHALL be disregarded as if it was not part of the tree. A
        value of "okay" indicates that the configuration SHALL be used.

      Note: By the devicetree specification, the lack of a status property will
      be treated as if the property existed with the value of "okay".

      Note: Using "ok" instead of "okay" is deprecated.
    enum:
      - "ok" # deprecated
      - "okay"
      - "disabled"
      - "reserved"
      - "fail"
      - "fail-sss"

  compatible:
    type: string-array
    required: true
    description: |
      The compatible property value consists of one or more strings that define
      the specific programming model for the device. In Zephyr this list of
      strings will be used for device driver and devicetree binding file
      selection.

      The property value consists of a concatenated list of strings, from most
      specific to most general. In the context of a device node this allows a
      device to express its compatibility with a family of similar devices,
      potentially allowing a single device driver to match against several
      devices.

      The recommended format is "manufacturer,model", where manufacturer is a
      string describing the name of the manufacturer (such as a stock ticker
      symbol), and model specifies the model number. The compatible string SHALL
      consist only of lowercase letters, digits and dashes, and SHALL start with
      a letter. A single comma MAY only be used following a vendor prefix.
      Underscores SHALL not be used.

      Note: These are SHOULD-requirements in the original specifications but in
      Zephyr they were upgraded to SHALL-requirements.

      Example:
        `compatible = "fsl,mpc8641", "ns16550";`

      In this example, Zephyr would first try to locate a device driver that
      supported fsl,mpc8641. If a driver was not found, it would then try to
      locate a driver that supported the more general ns16550 device type.

      Note: You can search for compatible drivers in the tree by replacing any
      non-alphanumeric character (namely commas and dashes) of a compatible
      string by an underscore (`_`) combined with the macro `DT_DRV_COMPAT`.

      Example:
        `DT_DRV_COMPAT fsl_mpc8641`

      You can locate corresponding binding files, by searching for *.y[a]ml
      files including one of the compatible strings with a colon rather than an
      equality sign.

      Example:
        `compatible: "fsl,mpc8641"`
