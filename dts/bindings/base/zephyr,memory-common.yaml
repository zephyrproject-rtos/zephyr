properties:
  zephyr,memory-region:
    type: string
    description: |
      Signify that this node should result in a dedicated linker script
      memory region in the final executable. The region address and size
      is taken from the <reg> property, while the name is the value of
      this property.

  zephyr,memory-region-flags:
    type: string
    description: |
      Set attributes such as read-only or executable for the linker script
      memory region. The string set here will be specified in parentheses
      after the area name in the linker script.

  zephyr,memory-region-mpu:
    type: string
    deprecated: true
    description: |
      Signify that this node should result in a dedicated MPU region.
      Deprecated in favor of 'zephyr,memory-attr'.

  zephyr,memory-attr:
    type: int
    description: |
      Attribute or set of attributes (bitmask) for the memory region. See
      'include/zephyr/dt-bindings/memory-attr/memory-attr.h' for a
      comprehensive list with description of possible values.
      Used by MMU/MPU systems to configure memory regions with specific
      attributes. This property should only be used on nodes with
      compatible = "zephyr,memory-region" to define separate memory-region
      nodes rather than annotating device nodes directly.
