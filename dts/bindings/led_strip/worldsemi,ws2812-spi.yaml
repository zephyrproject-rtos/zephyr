  Worldsemi WS2812 LED strip, SPI binding

  Driver bindings for controlling a WS2812 or compatible LED
  strip with a SPI master.

  The SPI driver should be usable as long as a zephyr SPI API driver
  is available for your board. Hardware specific tuning is required
  using these properties:

    - spi-max-frequency
    - spi-zero-frame
    - spi-one-frame
    - bits-per-symbol.

  The internal memory overhead is determined by 'bits-per-symbol'.
  For each bit of pixel data, the driver allocates N bits of RAM in
  its buffer, where N is the value of this property.

compatible: "worldsemi,ws2812-spi"

include: [spi-device.yaml, ws2812.yaml]

properties:
  spi-one-frame:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      The pattern/symbol to represent a single '1' bit. The length is
      defined by 'bits-per-symbol'.

  spi-zero-frame:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      The pattern/symbol to represent a single '0' bit. The length is
      defined by 'bits-per-symbol'.

  bits-per-symbol:
    type: int
    default: 8
    description: |
      The number of SPI bits used to represent a single data bit (a symbol).
      Must be between 3 and 8. The default value of 8 maintains backwards
      compatibility, as the driver originally mapped each data bit to a full
      8-bit SPI frame.
