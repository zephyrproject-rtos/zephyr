  Worldsemi WS2812 LED strip, SPI binding

  Driver bindings for controlling a WS2812 or compatible LED
  strip with a SPI master.

  The SPI driver should be usable as long as a zephyr SPI API driver
  is available for your board. Hardware specific tuning is required
  using these properties:

    - spi-max-frequency
    - spi-zero-frame
    - spi-one-frame.

  Use of this driver implies an 8x internal memory overhead (1 byte of
  driver RAM overhead per bit of pixel data).

compatible: "worldsemi,ws2812-spi"

include: [spi-device.yaml, ws2812.yaml]

properties:

  spi-cpol:
    type: boolean
    description: Set SPI clock polarity.

  spi-cpha:
    type: boolean
    description: Set SPI clock phase.

  spi-one-frame:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: 8-bit SPI frame to shift out for a 1 pulse.

  spi-zero-frame:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: 8-bit SPI frame to shift out for a 0 pulse.
