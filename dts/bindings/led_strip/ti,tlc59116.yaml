  Texas Instruments TLC59116 LED controller

  Driver bindings for I2C TLC59116 devices using a single device tree node.
  Length of daisy chains in pixels is defined by the chain-length
  property. Note: chain-length must be a multiple of 16. A single TLC59116 device
  supports 16 LEDs.

  Example device tree node on I2C address 0x60:

    &i2c0 {
      led_strip_60: tlc59116@60 {
        status = "okay";
        compatible = "ti,tlc59116";
        reg = <0x60>;
        label = "led_strip_60";
        chain-length = <16>;
        color-mapping = <LED_COLOR_ID_WHITE>;
      };
    };

compatible: "ti,tlc59116"
