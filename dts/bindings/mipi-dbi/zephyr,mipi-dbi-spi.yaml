  MIPI-DBI Mode C compatible SPI controller. This driver emulates MIPI DBI
  mode C using a SPI controller and GPIO pins
compatible: "zephyr,mipi-dbi-spi"

include: ["mipi-dbi-controller.yaml", "pinctrl-device.yaml"]

properties:
  spi-dev:
    type: phandle
    required: true
    description: |
      SPI device to use for data transfers with MIPI DBI commands. This SPI
      device should be connected to the MIPI DBI display.

  dc-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Data/command gpio pin. Required when using 4 wire SPI mode (Mode C1).
      Set to low when sending a command, or high when sending data.

  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Reset GPIO pin. Set high to reset the display

  write-only:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Only writes to display controller, do not perform reads.
      If all controllers are write-only, read functions will be
      optimized out for size.
      It can also be used as an alternative to half duplex when
      only one data line is connected.
