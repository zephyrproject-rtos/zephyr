  DBI settings for NXP DCnano LCD controller. DCNano is used in DPI mode by default,
  when used in DBI mode the compatible need to change in example overlay. For example:

  &lcdif {
      compatible = "nxp,mipi-dbi-dcnano-lcdif";
      clock-frequency = <279000000>;
      wr-period = <14>;
      wr-assert = <6>;
      wr-deassert = <13>;
      cs-assert = <1>;
      cs-deassert = <4>;
  };

compatible: "nxp,mipi-dbi-dcnano-lcdif"
