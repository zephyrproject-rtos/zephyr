# Common fields for MIPI DBI devices using Mode C (SPI)

properties:
  duplex:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      SPI Duplex mode, full or half. By default it's always full duplex thus 0
      as this is, by far, the most common mode.
      Selecting half duplex allows to use SPI MOSI as a bidirectional line,
      typically used when only one data line is connected.
      Use the macros, not the actual enum value. Here is the concordance
      list (see dt-bindings/spi/spi.h)
        0    SPI_FULL_DUPLEX
        2048 SPI_HALF_DUPLEX
  mipi-cpol:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      SPI clock polarity which indicates the clock idle state.
      If it is used, the clock idle state is logic high; otherwise, low.
  mipi-cpha:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      SPI clock phase that indicates on which edge data is sampled.
      If it is used, data is sampled on the second edge; otherwise, on the first edge.
  mipi-hold-cs:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      In some cases, it is necessary for the master to manage SPI chip select
      under software control, so that multiple spi transactions can be performed
      without releasing it. A typical use case is variable length SPI packets
      where the first spi transaction reads the length and the second spi transaction
      reads length bytes.
