    description:
      WDI gpio. If WDI remains high or low longer than the timeout period,
      then reset is triggered. The reset has a typical delay time of 200 ms for
      TPS3823/4/8, TPS3823A. The timer clears when reset is asserted or
      when WDI sees a rising edge or a falling edge. If unused, the WDI
      connection must be high impedance to prevent it from causing a reset
      event.

  timeout-period:
    type: int
    default: 1600
    description:
      Time-out period in milliseconds. Typical for TPS3823/4/8 and TPS3823A is
      1.6 seconds but minimum is 0.9. To avoid false positive watchdog reset
      the watchdog should be kicked within the minimum timeout period. The kick
      interval also needs to compensate for MCU clock tolerances which means it
      should be kicked with an interval less than 0.9 seconds. If this device
      is used as fallback for the task watchdog this can be achieved by setting
      e.g. TASK_WDT_MIN_TIMEOUT to 850 and TASK_WDT_HW_FALLBACK_DELAY to 750.
