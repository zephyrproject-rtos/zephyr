# Used to map nodes to bindings
compatible: "manufacturer,device"

# The 'compatible' above would match this node:
#
#     device {
#         compatible = "manufacturer,device";
#         ...
#     };
#
# Assuming no binding has 'compatible: "manufacturer,device-v2"', it would also
# match this node:
#
#     device {
#         compatible = "manufacturer,device-v2", "manufacturer,device";
#         ...
#     };
#
# Strings in 'compatible' properties on nodes are tried from left to right, and
# the first binding found is used.
#
# If more than one binding for a compatible is found, an error is raised.

# Many bindings have common fields. These are stored in files given in
# 'include', which are merged into the binding (with a recursive dictionary
# merge).
#
# If a key appears both in the binding and in a file it includes, then the
# value in the binding takes precedence. This can be used to change a
# 'required: false' from an inherited file to a 'required: true' (see the
# 'properties' description below).
#
# An error is raised if this binding has 'required: false' for some property
# for which the included file(s) have 'required: true'. Bindings can only
# "strengthen" requirements from files they include. This is meant to keep the
# organization clean.
#
# When including multiple files, any overlapping 'required' keys on properties
# in the included files are ORed together. This makes sure that a
# 'required: true' is always respected.
include: other.yaml # or [other1.yaml, other2.yaml]

# If the node describes a bus, then the bus type should be given, like below.
# The name has "child" in it since it describes the bus children of the node
# appear on.
child-bus: <string describing bus type, e.g. "i2c">

# If the node appears on a bus, then the bus type should be given, like below.
#
# When looking for a binding for a node, the code checks if the binding for the
# parent node contains 'child-bus: <bus type>'. If it does, then only bindings
# with a matching 'parent-bus: <bus type>' are considered. This allows the same
# type of device to have different bindings depending on what bus it appears
# on.
parent-bus: <string describing bus type, e.g. "i2c">

# 'properties' describes properties on the node, e.g.
#
#   reg = <1 2>;
#   current-speed = <115200>;
#   label = "foo";
#
# This is used to check that required properties appear, and to
# control the format of output generated for them. Except for some
# special-cased properties like 'reg', only properties listed here will
# generate output.
#
# A typical property entry looks like this:
#
#   <property name>:
#     required: <true | false>
#     type: <string | int | boolean | array | uint8-array | string-array |
#            phandle | phandles | phandle-array | compound>
#     description: <description of the property>
#     enum:
#       - <item1>
#       - <item2>
#       ...
#       - <itemN>
#     const: <string | int>
#     default: <default>
#
# These types are available:
#
#   - 'type: int' is for properties that are assigned a single 32-bit value,
#     like
#
#         frequency = <100>;
#
#   - 'type: array' is for properties that are assigned zero or more 32-bit
#     values, like
#
#         pin-config = <1 2 3>;
#
#   - 'type: uint8-array' is for properties that are assigned zero or more
#     bytes with the [] syntax, like
#
#         lookup-table = [89 AB CD EF];
#
#     Each byte is given in hex.
#
#     This type is called 'bytestring' in the Devicetree specification.
#
#   - 'type: string' is for properties that are assigned a single string, like
#
#         ident = "foo";
#
#   - 'type: string-array' if for properties that are assigned zero or more
#     strings, like
#
#         idents = "foo", "bar", "baz";
#
#   - 'type: boolean' is for properties used as flags that don't take a value,
#     like
#
#         hw-flow-control;
#
#     The macro generated for the property gets set to 1 if the property exists
#     on the node, and to 0 otherwise. When combined with 'required: true',
#     this type just forces the flag to appear on the node. The output will
#     always be 1 in that case.
#
#     Warning: Since a macro is always generated for 'type: boolean'
#     properties, don't use #ifdef in tests. Do this instead:
#
#         #if DT_SOME_BOOLEAN_PROP == 1
#
#   - 'type: phandle' is for properties that are assigned a single phandle,
#     like
#
#         foo = <&label>;
#
#   - 'type: phandles' is for properties that are assigned zero or more
#     phandles, like
#
#         foo = <&label1 &label2 ...>;
#
#   - 'type: phandle-array' is for properties that take a list of phandles and
#     (possibly) 32-bit numbers, like
#
#         pwms = <&ctrl-1 1 2 &ctrl-2 3 4>;
#
#     This type requires that the property works in the standard way that
#     devicetree properties like pwms, clocks, *-gpios, and io-channels work.
#     Taking 'pwms' as an example, the final -s is stripped from the property
#     name, and #pwm-cells is looked up in the node for the controller
#     (&ctrl-1/&ctrl-2) to determine the number of data values after the
#     phandle. The binding for each controller must also have a *-cells key
#     (e.g. pwm-cells), giving names to data values. See below for an
#     explanation of *-cells.
#
#     A *-names (e.g. pwm-names) property can appear on the node as well,
#     giving a name to each entry (the 'pwms' example above has two entries,
#     <&ctrl-1 1 2> and <&ctrl-2 3 4>).
#
#     Because other property names are derived from the name of the property by
#     removing the final -s, the property name must end in -s. An error is
#     raised if it doesn't.
#
#     *-gpios properties are special-cased so that e.g. foo-gpios resolves to
#     #gpio-cells rather than #foo-gpio-cells.
#
#     All phandle-array properties support mapping through *-map properties,
#     e.g. gpio-map. See the devicetree spec.
#
#   - 'type: compound' is a catch-all for more complex types, e.g.
#
#         foo = <&label1>, [01 02];
#
# 'type: array' and the other array types also allow splitting the value into
# several <> blocks, e.g. like this:
#
#     foo = <1 2>, <3 4>;                         // Okay for 'type: array'
#     foo = <&label1 &label2>, <&label3 &label4>; // Okay for 'type: phandles'
#     foo = <&label1 1 2>, <&label2 3 4>;         // Okay for 'type: phandle-array'
#     etc.
#
# The optional 'default:' setting gives a value that will be used if the
# property is missing from the device tree node. If 'default: <default>' is
# given for a property <prop> and <prop> is missing, then the output will be as
# if '<prop> = <default>' had appeared (except YAML data types are used for the
# default value).
#
# Note that it only makes sense to combine 'default:' with 'required: false'.
# Combining it with 'required: true' will raise an error.
#
# See below for examples of 'default:'. Putting 'default:' on any property type
# besides those used in the examples will raise an error.

# 'child-binding' can be used when a node has children that all share the same
# properties. Each child gets the contents of 'child-binding' as its binding
# (though an explicit 'compatible = ...' on the child node takes precedence, if
# a binding is found for it).
#
# The example below is for a binding for PWM LEDs, where the child nodes are
# required to have a 'pwms' property. It corresponds to this .dts structure
# (assuming the binding has 'compatible: "pwm-leds"'):
#
# pwmleds {
#         compatible = "pwm-leds";
#
#         red_pwm_led {
#                 pwms = <&pwm3 4 15625000>;
#         };
#         green_pwm_led {
#                 pwms = <&pwm3 0 15625000>;
#         };
#         ...
# };

# 'child-binding' also works recursively. For example, the binding below would
# provide a binding for the 'grandchild' node in this .dts (assuming
# 'compatible: "foo"'):
#
# parent {
#         compatible = "foo";
#         child {
#                 grandchild {

#                 };
#         };

# of 'child-binding:' nesting (like below) is supported. This restriction will

# If the binding describes an interrupt controller, GPIO controller, pinmux
# device, or any other node referenced by other nodes via 'phandle-array'

#
# To understand the purpose of *-cells, assume that some node has

#     pwms = <&pwm-ctrl 1 2>;
#
# , where &pwm-ctrl refers to a node whose binding is this file.
#
# The <1 2> part of the property value is called a *specifier* (this
# terminology is from the devicetree specification), and contains additional
# data associated with the GPIO. Here, the specifier has two cells, and the
# node pointed at by &gpio-ctrl is expected to have '#pwm-cells = <2>'.
#
# *-cells gives a name to each cell in the specifier. These names are used when
# generating identifiers.
#
# In this example, assume that 1 refers to a pin and that 2 is a flag value.
# This gives a *-cells assignment like below.
