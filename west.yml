# The west manifest file for upstream Zephyr.
#
# The per-installation west configuration file, .west/config, sets the
# path to the project containing this file in the [manifest] section's
# "path" variable.
#
# You are free to create your own manifest files and put them in any
# repository you want, to create your own custom Zephyr installations.
# For example, you could create a manifest file in your own out of
# tree application directory, which would pull this zephyr repository
# in as an ordinary project.
#
# You can pass your manifest repositories to west init when creating a
# new Zephyr installation. See the west documentation for more
# information.
