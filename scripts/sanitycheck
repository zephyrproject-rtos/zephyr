"""Zephyr Sanity Tests

This script scans for the set of unit test applications in the git
repository and attempts to execute them. By default, it tries to
build each test case on one platform per architecture, using a precedence
list defined in an archtecture configuration file, and if possible
run the tests in the QEMU emulator.

Test cases are detected by the presence of a 'testcase.ini' file in
the application's project directory. This file may contain one or
more blocks, each identifying a test scenario. The title of the block
is a name for the test case, which only needs to be unique for the
test cases specified in that testcase.ini file. The full canonical
name for each test case is <path to test case under samples/>/<block>.

Each testcase.ini block can define the following key/value pairs:

 tags = <list of tags> (required)
    A set of string tags for the testcase. Usually pertains to
    functional domains but can be anything. Command line invocations
    of this script can filter the set of tests to run based on tag.

  skip = <True|False>
    skip testcase unconditionally. This can be used for broken tests.

  extra_args = <list of extra arguments>
    Extra arguments to pass to Make when building or running the
    test case.

  build_only = <True|False>
    If true, don't try to run the test under QEMU even if the
    selected platform supports it.

  timeout = <number of seconds>
    Length of time to run test in QEMU before automatically killing it.
    Default to 60 seconds.

  arch_whitelist = <list of arches, such as x86, arm, arc>
    Set of architectures that this test case should only be run for.

  arch_exclude = <list of arches, such as x86, arm, arc>
    Set of architectures that this test case should not run on.

  platform_whitelist = <list of platforms>
    Set of platforms that this test case should only be run for.

  platform_exclude = <list of platforms>
    Set of platforms that this test case should not run on.

  config_whitelist = <list of config options>
    Config options can either be config names like CONFIG_FOO which
    match if the configuration is defined to any value, or key/value
    pairs like CONFIG_FOO=bar which match if it is set to a specific
    value. May prepend a '!' to invert the match.

Architectures and platforms are defined in an archtecture configuration
file which are stored by default in scripts/sanity_chk/arches/. These
each define an [arch] block with the following key/value pairs:

  name = <arch name>
    The name of the arch. Example: x86

  platforms = <list of supported platforms in order of precedence>
    List of supported platforms for this arch. The ordering here
    is used to select a default platform to build for that arch.

For every platform defined, there must be a corresponding block for it
in the arch configuration file. This block can be empty if there are
no special definitions for that arch. Options are:

  qemu_support = <True|False> (default False)
    Indicates whether binaries for this platform can run under QEMU

  microkernel_support = <True|False> (default True)
    Indicates whether this platform supports microkernel or just nanokernel

The set of test cases that actually run depends on directives in the
testcase and archtecture .ini file and options passed in on the command
line. If there is every any confusion, running with -v or --discard-report
can help show why particular test cases were skipped.

Metrics (such as pass/fail state and binary size) for the last code
release are stored in scripts/sanity_chk/sanity_last_release.csv.
To update this, pass the --all --release options.

Most everyday users will run with no arguments.
