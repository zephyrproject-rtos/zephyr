        The initial state of the LED. Valid values are LED_STATE_OFF (0),
        LED_STATE_ON (1), and LED_STATE_KEEP (2). If the LED is already on or
        off and the default-state property is set the to same value, then no
        glitch should be produced where the LED momentarily turns off (or on).
        The LED_STATE_KEEP setting will keep the LED at whatever its current
        state is, without producing a glitch. The default is LED_STATE_OFF (0)
        if this property is not present.
