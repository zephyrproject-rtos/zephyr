  Top-level binding file for testing included property spec paths.

  base.yaml: specifies properties "x" and "y"
  modified.yaml: includes base.yaml, modifies property "x"
  top.yaml (this file): includes modified.yaml, specifies property "p"

  From the top-level binding, we expect:
  - "x" was last modified in modified.yaml
  - "y" was last modified in base.yaml
  - "p" was last modified in top.yaml

compatible: top-level

include: modified.yaml

properties:
  p:
    type: int
