description: GPIO controller for bindings tests

compatible: "gpio-controller"

# The property definitions for gpio-controller and #gpio-cells are
# intentionally omitted from here. The behavior of a GPIO controller
# is defined in dt-schema and the #gpio-cells property is implicitly
# defined in the DT Spec itself, so we want the devicetree package to
# behave appropriately regardless of what may or may not be in the
# Zephyr-specific bindings.
