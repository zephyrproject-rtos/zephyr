title: DMA Client Base Structure
type: dma-client
version: 0.1

description: >
    This binding gives the base structures for all DMA clients.

properties:

    dmas:
      type: array
      category: required
      description: >
        List of one or more DMA specifiers, each consisting of
        - A phandle pointing to DMA controller node
        - A number of integer cells, as determined by the
        dma-cells property in the node referenced by phandle
        containing DMA controller specific information. This
        typically contains a DMA request line number or a
        channel number, but can contain any data that is
        required for configuring a channel..
      generation: define

    dma-names:
      type: array
      category: optional
      description: >
        Contains one identifier string for each DMA specifier in
        the dmas property. The specific strings that can be used
        are defined in the binding of the DMA client device.
        Multiple DMA specifiers can be used to represent
        alternatives and in this case the dma-names for those
        DMA specifiers must be identical (see examples).
