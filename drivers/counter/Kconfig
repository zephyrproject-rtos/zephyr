menuconfig COUNTER
	bool "Counter drivers"
	help
	  Enable support for counter and timer.

if COUNTER

config COUNTER_INIT_PRIORITY
	int "Counter init priority"
	default 60
	help
	  Counter driver device initialization priority.

config COUNTER_SHELL
	bool "Counter shell"
	depends on SHELL
	help
	  Enable Shell Commands for Counter and Timer

config COUNTER_64BITS_FREQ
	bool
	help
	  Select this option if the counter driver should use 64-bits for frequency.
	  This is typically set by drivers that have frequencies greater than
	  4,294,967,295 Hz.

config COUNTER_SUPPORTS_64BITS_TICKS
	bool
	help
	  Select this option if the counter driver supports 64-bits for ticks.
	  This is typically set by drivers that require extended
	  tick ranges beyond the 32-bit limit.

config COUNTER_64BITS_TICKS
	bool "API to support ticks longer than 32-bits"
	depends on COUNTER_SUPPORTS_64BITS_TICKS
	help
	  This enables APIs to handle ticks larger than 32-bits with a
	  64-bit typedef. It is up to the driver to implement the necessary
	  functions to supports.
