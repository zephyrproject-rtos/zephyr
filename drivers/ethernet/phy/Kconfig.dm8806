	help
	  This functionality prevents the host SMI bus to be interferered by the
	  noise on board-level. During write procedure, the written value in
	  register will be applied until the correct checksum is written. In read
	  procedure, the hardware calculated checksum is compared with the software
	  calculated one to detect correctness of received data.

config PHY_DM8806_SMI_BUS_CHECK_REPETITION
	int "SMI bus transmission repetitions"
	depends on PHY_DM8806_SMI_BUS_CHECK
	default 5
	help
	  The numbers of SMI bus transmission repetition in case if CRC checksum
	  fails during read or write. After this numbers of repetition, the reading
	  message is dropped and will not be passed to the system. In write
	  procedure, the written value in register will be applied until the correct
	  checksum is written to the PHY register.
