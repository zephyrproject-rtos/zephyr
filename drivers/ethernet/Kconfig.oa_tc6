	  Serial Interface protocol for supporting 10BASE-T1x MAC-PHYs.

config OA_TC6_IRQ_THREAD_STACK_SIZE
	int "Stack size of OA TC6 thread that processes IRQ"

	help
	  Size of the stack used for internal thread which is ran to
	  process raised INT IRQ.

config OA_TC6_IRQ_THREAD_PRIO
	int "Priority for internal incoming packet handler"

	  Priority level for internal thread which is ran for LAN

	  Given timeout in milliseconds. Maximum amount of time

	  a memory buffer.

config OA_TC6_TX_RX_BUFFER_SIZE
	int "OA SPI TX RX BUFFER SIZE"
	default 31
	range 1 31
	help
	  Size of the buffer to transmit and receive SPI chunks to MAC-PHY
	  and from MAC-PHY respectively. One buffer size is equal to 68
	  bytes. (Size of the single OASPI chunk is 68 bytes). Buffer size
	  31 is equal to (31 * 68) 2108 bytes. In full duplex mode same
	  buffer size should be used in TX and RX path. For SoCs with more
	  resources, set the maximum value of 31 (2108 bytes) to achieve
	  higher bandwidth. For SoCs with limited resources, set the value
	  to at least 1 (68 bytes).
