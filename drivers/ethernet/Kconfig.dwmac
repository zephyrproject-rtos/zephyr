	  This is a driver for the Synopsys DesignWare MAC, also referred to
	  as "DesignWare Cores Ethernet Quality-of-Service". Hardware versions
	  4.x and 5.x are supported.

	  Platform specific glue support is also required. This driver is
	  currently available on targets using the STM32H7X series as an
	  alternative to the eth_stm32_hal driver. Support for a generic DT
	  and MMU based platform is also provided.

	  Not yet implemented:
	  - MDIO (currently relying on default PHY config)
	  - PTP support
	  - VLAN support
	  - various hardware offloads (when available)

	help
	  A higher number allows for more packets to be queued which may
	  improve throughput, but that requires more transient memory.
	  However there must be enough descriptors to hold all fragments
	  of a full-size packet to be transmitted or the packet will be
	  dropped.

	  Fragment size is influenced by CONFIG_NET_BUF_DATA_SIZE.

config DWMAC_NB_RX_DESCS
	int "Number of entries in the receive descriptor ring"
	default 16
	range 4 128
	help
	  Received packets are spread across the required number of fragment
	  buffers. Each RX fragment has a size of CONFIG_NET_BUF_DATA_SIZE.
	  There is one descriptor entry per fragment.

	  A higher number allows for more packets to be received without
	  immediate intervention from the CPU but requires more transient
	  memory. A smaller number increases the risk of an overflow and
	  dropped packets.
