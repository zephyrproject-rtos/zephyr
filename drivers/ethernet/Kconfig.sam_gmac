	  This option is meant to be used only for debugging. Use it to force all
	  traffic to be routed through a specific hardware queue. With this enabled
	  it is easier to verify whether the chosen hardware queue actually works.
	  This works only if there are four or fewer RX traffic classes enabled, as
	  the SAM GMAC hardware supports screening up to four traffic classes.

	int "Network RX buffers preallocated by the SAM ETH driver"

	help
	  Number of network buffers that will be permanently allocated by the
	  Ethernet driver. These buffers are used in receive path. They are
	  preallocated by the driver and made available to the GMAC module to be
	  filled in with incoming data. Their number has to be large enough to fit
	  at least one complete Ethernet frame. SAM ETH driver will always allocate
	  that amount of buffers for itself thus reducing the NET_BUF_RX_COUNT
	  which is a total amount of RX data buffers used by the whole networking
	  stack. One has to ensure that NET_PKT_RX_COUNT is large enough to
	  fit at least two Ethernet frames: one being received by the GMAC module
	  and the other being processed by the higher layer networking stack.
