	  IT8XXX2 uses shared ns16550.c driver which does not
	  provide a power management callback, so create driver
	  to handle IT8XXX2 specific UART features. In addition
	  to use pm_action_cb, we also need to make some setting
	  at uart_it8xxx2_init.

	help
	  Initialization priority for the UART wrapper driver on ITE IT8XXX2,
	  must be set to a lower priority than the matching ns16550 device
	  (CONFIG_SERIAL_INIT_PRIORITY).
