	  This enables a PTY based UART driver for the POSIX ARCH with up to 2 UARTs.
	  For the first UART port, the driver can be configured
	  to either connect to the terminal from which the executable was run, or into
	  one dedicated pseudoterminal for that UART.

	help
	  Connect this UART to its own pseudoterminal. This is the preferred
	  option for users who want to use Zephyr's shell.
	  Moreover this option does not conflict with any other native
	  backend which may use the invoking shell standard input/output.
	  Note it can be overridden from command line

config UART_NATIVE_PTY_0_ON_STDINOUT
	bool "Connect the first PTY UART to the invoking shell stdin/stdout"
	help
	  Connect this UART to the stdin & stdout of the calling shell/terminal
	  which invoked the native executable. This is good enough for
	  automated testing, or when feeding from a file/pipe.
	  Note that other, non UART messages, will also be printed to the
	  terminal.
	  It is strongly discouraged to try to use this option with the new
	  shell interactively, as the default terminal configuration is NOT
	  appropriate for interactive use.

	  If the native executable is called with the --attach_uart
	  command line option, this will be the default command which will be
	  run to attach a new terminal to the 1st UART.
	  Note that this command must have one, and only one, '%s' as
	  placeholder for the pseudoterminal device name (e.g. /dev/pts/35)
	  This is only applicable if the UART_0 is configured to use its own
	  PTY with NATIVE_UART_0_ON_OWN_PTY.
	  The 2nd UART will not be affected by this option.
	  If you are using GNOME, then you can use this command string
	  'gnome-terminal -- screen %s'
