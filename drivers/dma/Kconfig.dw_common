config DMA_DW_FIFO_PARTITION
	bool "FIFO Partitioning"
	help
	  FIFO partition feature

config DMA_DW_LLI_POOL_SIZE
	int "number of LLI structs in an allocation pool"
	default 2
	help
	  The number of LLI structs in a statically allocated pool. Each channel has its own
	  LLI struct pool. If during dma_config() a log notes there are not enough LLI structs
	  then this should be increased to match the need.

config DMA_DW_HW_LLI
	bool "hardware supports scatter gather"
	default y
	help
	  The hardware is by default expected to support hardware LLI (scatter gather).
	  When not enabled the driver will still perform scatter gather but using software
	  to run through the scatter gather list.

config DMA_DW_SUSPEND_DRAIN
	bool "channels should be suspended and drained on stop"
	depends on DMA_INTEL_ADSP_GPDMA
	help
	  Rather than immediately stopping a DMA channel the channel is suspended
	  with the DRAIN bit flag set to allow for the hardware FIFO to be drained
	  before stopping the channel.

config DMA_DW_HOST_MASK
	int "memory space mask"
	default 0
	help
	  Some instances of the DesignWare DMAC require a mask applied to source/destination
	  addresses to signifiy the memory space the address is in.

config DMA_DW_CHANNEL_COUNT
	int "dw max channel count"
	default 8
	help
	  Channel count for designware DMA instances.
