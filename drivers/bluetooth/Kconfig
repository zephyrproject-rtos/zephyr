	  Bluetooth H:4 UART driver. Requires hardware flow control

	  Bluetooth three-wire (H:5) UART driver. Implementation of HCI
	  Three-Wire UART Transport Layer.

config BLUETOOTH_NO_DRIVER
	bool "No default HCI driver"
	help
	  This is intended for unit tests where no internal driver
	  should be selected.

config BLUETOOTH_HOST_BUFFERS
	bool "Host managed incoming data buffers"
	default n
	help
	  Enable this to have the host stack manage incoming ACL data
	  and HCI event buffers. This makes sense for all HCI drivers
	  that talk to a controller running on a different CPU.

	  If the controller resides in the same address space it may
	  make sense to have the lower layers manage these buffers, in
	  which case this option can be left disabled.

config	BLUETOOTH_DEBUG_DRIVER
	bool "Bluetooth driver debug"
	depends on BLUETOOTH_DEBUG && BLUETOOTH_UART
	default n
	help
	  This option enables debug support for the chosen
	  Bluetooth HCI driver

config BLUETOOTH_UART_ON_DEV_NAME
	string "Device Name of UART Device for Bluetooth"
	default "UART_0"
	depends on BLUETOOTH_UART
	help
	  This option specifies the name of UART device to be used
	  for Bluetooth.

	  Power Management support for Nordic BLE nRF51 chip. Allows to enable,
	  disable the chip and handle wakeups.

config BLUETOOTH_WAIT_NOP
	bool "Wait for \"NOP\" Command Complete event during init"
	help
	  Some controllers emit a Command Complete event for the NOP
	  opcode to indicate that they're ready to receive commands.
	  This option should be selected if the controller used
	  exhibits such behavior.
