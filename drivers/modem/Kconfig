	depends on SERIAL_SUPPORT_INTERRUPT
	select UART_INTERRUPT_DRIVEN

	help
	  This driver allows modem drivers to communicate over UART with custom
	  defined protocols. Driver doesn't inspect received data and all
	  aspects of received protocol data are handled by application via
	  work method provided.  This driver differs from the pipe UART driver
	  in that callbacks are executed in a different work queue and data is
	  passed around in k_pipe structures.

config MODEM_CONTEXT
	bool "Modem context helper driver [EXPERIMENTAL]"
	select EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  This driver allows modem drivers to communicate with an interface
	  using custom defined protocols. Driver doesn't inspect received data
	  and all aspects of received protocol data are handled by application
	  work method provided.  This driver combines abstractions for:
	  modem interface, command handler, pin config and socket handling each
	  of which will need to be configured.

config MODEM_CONTEXT_MAX_NUM

config MODEM_CONTEXT_VERBOSE_DEBUG
	bool "Verbose debug output in the modem context"
	help
	  Enabling this setting will turn on VERY heavy debugging from the
	  modem context helper.  Do NOT leave on for production.

config MODEM_IFACE_UART
	bool "UART-based modem interface"
	select RING_BUFFER
	help
	  To configure this layer for use, create a modem_iface_uart_data

	  along with the modem_iface reference from your modem_context object
	  and the UART device name.

	  to receive large packets.

config MODEM_IFACE_UART_ASYNC_RX_NUM_BUFFERS
	int "Number of RX buffers available to the UART driver"
	default 2

	  This value needs to be twice the number of UART modems using the
	  driver to avoid buffer starvation.

config MODEM_IFACE_UART_ASYNC_RX_TIMEOUT_US
	int "Timeout for flushing RX buffers after receiving no additional data"
	default 278
	help
	  Decreasing this value can help increase data throughput when high
	  baudrates are used. 278us is 4 bytes at 115200 baud. Decreasing this
	  value too much can result in spurious interrupts. Leaving it too
	  high can reduce data throughput.

config MODEM_CMD_HANDLER
	bool "Generic modem command handler"
	select NET_BUF
	help
	  This generic command handler uses a modem interface to process
	  incoming data and hand it back to the modem driver via callbacks
	  defined for:
	  - modem responses
	  - unsolicited messages
	  - specified handlers for current operation
	  To configure this layer for use, create a modem_cmd_handler_data
	  object and pass it's reference to modem_cmd_handler_init() along with
	  the modem_cmd_handler reference from your modem_context object.

config MODEM_CMD_HANDLER_MAX_PARAM_COUNT
	int "Maximum number of params parsed per command"
	depends on MODEM_CMD_HANDLER
	default 6
	help
	  This option sets the maximum number of parameters which may be
	  parsed by the command handler.  This is also limited by the length
	  of the match_buf (match_buf_len) field as it needs to be large
	  enough to hold a single line of data (ending with /r).

config MODEM_SOCKET
	bool "Generic modem socket support layer"
	help
	  This layer provides much of the groundwork for keeping track of
	  modem "sockets" throughout their lifecycle (from the initial offload
	  API calls through the command handler call back layers).
	  To configure this layer for use, create a modem_socket_config
	  object with your socket data and pass it's reference to
	  modem_socket_init().
	  Note that the modem socket uses runtime allocated file descriptors
	  reserved from the fdtable, for which the max count is set using the
	  Kconfig option ZVFS_OPEN_MAX. Make sure to update this value as both
	  the modem sockets and the POSIX_API, if used, share them.

config MODEM_SOCKET_PACKET_COUNT
	int "Maximum number of stored packet sizes per socket"
	depends on MODEM_SOCKET
	default 6
	help
	  As the modem indicates more data is available to be received,
	  these values are organized into "packets".  This setting limits
	  the maximum number of packet sizes the socket can keep track of.

config MODEM_SHELL
	bool "Modem shell utilities"
	select SHELL
	help
	  Activate shell module that provides modem utilities like
	  sending a command to the modem UART.

config MODEM_SIM_NUMBERS
	bool "Query the SIM for IMSI and ICCID"
	default y
	help
	  Query the SIM card for the IMSI and ICCID identifiers. This
	  can be disabled if the application does not use a SIM.

config MODEM_CELL_INFO
	bool "Query for operator and cell info"
	help
	  Query for numerical operator id, location area code and cell id.
