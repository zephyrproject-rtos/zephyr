	  This is an emulator for the Atmel AT24 series of I2C-attached EEPROMs.

	  At present it only supports 8-bit addressing. The size of the EEPROM
	  is given by the 'size' property. See the binding for further details.

	  Enable support for I2C EEPROMs compatible with Atmel's AT24 family.

	  There are multiple vendors manufacturing I2C EEPROMs compatible with
	  the programming model of the Atmel AT24.

	  Examples of compatible EEPROM families:
	  - Microchip AT24xxx
	  - ST M24xxx

	  AT2X EEPROM driver device initialization priority.

	  The EEPROM is connected to I2C or SPI bus an has to be initialized
	  after I2C/SPI driver.
