config SPI_NRFX_RAM_BUFFER_SIZE

	default 8
	depends on SPI_NRFX_SPIM
	help
	  Because of using EasyDMA, SPIM peripherals cannot use transmit and
	  receive buffers from all memory locations. They are restricted to
	  buffers located in certain RAM memories only. Therefore, each SPIM
	  driver instance needs to use an intermediate local RAM buffer,
	  to transfer data in chunks not exceeding the size of that buffer,
	  and to copy those chunks between the local buffer and the one
	  specified in the transfer request if the latter is not accessible
	  by EasyDMA.

	  This option specifies the size in bytes of such local RAM buffers
	  for both TX and RX paths. A size of 0 means that this feature should
	  be disabled and the driver user must take care of not making transfer
	  requests with buffers not accessible by EasyDMA since such transfers
	  will fail.

config SPI_NRFX_WAKE_TIMEOUT_US

	  Maximum amount of time (in microseconds) that SPI master should wait
	  for SPI slave to wake up after the WAKE line is asserted. Used only
	  by instances that have the WAKE line configured (see the wake-gpios
	  devicetree property).
