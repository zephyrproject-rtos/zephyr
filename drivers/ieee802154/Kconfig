config  TI_CC2520_LEGACY
	bool "TI CC2520 Driver support"
	depends on NET_UIP
	default n

config  TI_CC2520

	depends on NET_YAIP
	select NET_L2_IEEE802154
	default n

if TI_CC2520_LEGACY || TI_CC2520

config SYS_LOG_TI_CC2520_LEVEL
	int
	prompt "CC2520 driver log level"
	default 0
	help
	Sets log level for 802.15.4 CC2520 driver.

	Levels are:

	- 0 OFF, do not write

	- 1 ERROR, only write SYS_LOG_ERR

	- 2 WARNING, write SYS_LOG_WRN in adition to previous level

	- 3 INFO, write SYS_LOG_INF in adition to previous levels

	- 4 DEBUG, write SYS_LOG_DBG in adition to previous levels

config TI_CC2520_DRV_NAME
	string "TI CC2520 Driver's name"
	default "cc2520"
	help
	This option sets the driver name

config TI_CC2520_SPI_DRV_NAME
	string "SPI driver's name to use to access CC2520"
	default ""
	help
	This option is mandatory to set which SPI controller to use in order
	to actually control the CC2520 chip.

config TI_CC2520_SPI_FREQ
	int "SPI system frequency"
	default 0
	help
	This option sets the SPI controller's frequency. Beware this value
	depends on the SPI controller being used and also on the system
	clock.

config TI_CC2520_SPI_SLAVE
	int "SPI slave linked to CC2520"
	default 0
	help
	This option sets the SPI slave number SPI controller has to switch
	to when dealing with CC2520 chip.

config TI_CC2520_FIBER_STACK_SIZE
	int "Driver's internal fiber stack size"
	default 800
	help
	This option sets the driver's stack size for its internal fiber.
	The default value should be sufficient, but it case it prooves to be
	a too little, this option makes it easy to play with the size.

config TI_CC2520_CHANNEL
	int "TI CC2520 Channel"
	default 26
	range 11 26
	help
	All the 802.15.4 devices that want to connect to each other need
	to have same channel. Default channel is 26.

config TI_CC2520_AUTO_CRC
	bool "Let the chip handling CRC on reception"
	default y
	help
	When receiving a packet, the hardware can verify the CRC by itself
	and will provide a flag letting know the success - or not - on
	a flag on the footer.

config TI_CC2520_LINK_DETAILS
	bool "Forward RSSI and link information on reception to upper stack"
	default n
	depends on TI_CC2520_LEGACY
	select TI_CC2520_AUTO_CRC
	help
	If necessary, it will be possible to grab link and RSSI information
	from the packet footer and forward them to the above stack.

config TI_CC2520_AUTO_ACK
	bool "Let the chip handle TX/RX IEEE 802.15.4 ACK requests"
	default n
	select TI_CC2520_AUTO_CRC
	help
	The chip is able to reply by itself to ACK requests as well as
	waiting for an ACK when a TX packet is requesting an ACK. However,
	this feature requires the chip to get hardware filtering on, and
	thus the above stack needs to provide the right information for such
	filtering feature to work.

config UPIPE_15_4
	bool "UART PIPE fake radio driver support for QEMU"
	depends on BOARD_QEMU_X86
	select NET_YAIP
	select UART_PIPE
	default n

config UPIPE_15_4_DRV_NAME
	string "UART PIPE Driver name"
	default "upipe_15_4"
	depends on UPIPE_15_4

config SYS_LOG_UPIPE_15_4_LEVEL
	int "UART PIPE driver log level"
	default 0
	depends on UPIPE_15_4
	help
	Sets log level for fake 802.15.4 UPIPE driver.

	Levels are:

	- 0 OFF, do not write

	- 1 ERROR, only write SYS_LOG_ERR

	- 2 WARNING, write SYS_LOG_WRN in adition to previous level

	- 3 INFO, write SYS_LOG_INF in adition to previous levels

	- 4 DEBUG, write SYS_LOG_DBG in adition to previous levels
