	int "Driver's internal RX thread stack size"
	default 800
	help
	  This option sets the driver's stack size for its internal RX thread.
	  The default value should be sufficient, but in case it proves to be
	  a too little one, this option makes it easy to play with the size.

config IEEE802154_RF2XX_INIT_PRIO
	int "RF2X initialization priority"
	default 80
	help
	  Set the initialization priority number. Do not mess with it unless
	  you know what you are doing. Beware rf2xx requires gpio and spi to
	  be ready first (and sometime gpio should be the very first as spi
	  might need it too). And of course it has to start before the net stack.
