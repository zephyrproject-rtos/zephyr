	  Dictates the size of stack allocation and number of writes performed by
	  each retained memory clear operation.

	  BBRAMs do not have a clear operation; to clear one, we must repeatedly
	  write chunks of zeroes. Each clear operation will stack-allocate this
	  many bytes, and then make ⌈BBRAM size / clear chunk size⌉ writes.

	  Enable driver for retained memory in RAM.

	bool "Generic Zephyr register retained memory driver"
	default y
	depends on DT_HAS_ZEPHYR_RETAINED_REG_ENABLED
