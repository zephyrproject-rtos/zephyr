	range 2 16
	help
	  This determines how many buffers the driver should allocate and
	  reserve for the DMA engine. The memory slab used with the DMIC
	  API should provide at least one more buffer than this value, since
	  a buffer will always be in the RX queue.

config DMIC_MCUX_QUEUE_SIZE
	int "Size of DMIC buffer queue"
	default 8
	help
	  This sets the size of the RX buffer queue for the DMIC. Up to this
	  many buffers may be queued by the DMIC once it is triggered, before
	  the application must read buffers to avoid data being dropped.
