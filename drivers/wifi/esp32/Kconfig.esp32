	help
	  Set the number of WiFi static RX buffers. Each buffer takes approximately 1.6KB of RAM.
	  The static rx buffers are allocated when esp_wifi_init is called, they are not freed
	  until esp_wifi_deinit is called.

	  WiFi hardware use these buffers to receive all 802.11 frames.
	  A higher number may allow higher throughput but increases memory use. If ESP32_WIFI_AMPDU_RX_ENABLED
	  is enabled, this value is recommended to set equal or bigger than ESP32_WIFI_RX_BA_WIN in order to
	  achieve better throughput and compatibility with both stations and APs.

config ESP32_WIFI_DYNAMIC_RX_BUFFER_NUM
	int "Max number of WiFi dynamic RX buffers"
	range 0 128
	default 32
	help
	  Set the number of WiFi dynamic RX buffers, 0 means unlimited RX buffers
	  will be allocated (provided sufficient free RAM). The size of each dynamic
	  RX buffer depends on the size of the received data frame.

	  For each received data frame, the WiFi driver makes a copy to an RX buffer
	  and then delivers it to the high layer TCP/IP stack. The dynamic RX buffer
	  is freed after the higher layer has successfully received the data frame.

	  For some applications, WiFi data frames may be received faster than the
	  application can process them. In these cases we may run out of memory if
	  RX buffer number is unlimited (0). If a dynamic RX buffer limit is set,
	  it should be at least the number of static RX buffers.

	  static TX buffer is fixed to about 1.6KB.

	  If "Dynamic" is selected, each WiFi TX buffer is allocated as needed
	  when a data frame is delivered to the Wifi driver from the TCP/IP stack.
	  The buffer is freed after the data frame has been sent by the WiFi driver.
	  The size of each dynamic TX buffer depends on the length of each data
	  frame sent by the TCP/IP layer.

	  If PSRAM is enabled, "Static" should be selected to guarantee enough
	  WiFi TX buffers. If PSRAM is disabled, "Dynamic" should be selected
	  to improve the utilization of RAM.

	  called, they are not released until esp_wifi_deinit() is called.

	  For each transmitted data frame from the higher layer TCP/IP stack,
	  the WiFi driver makes a copy of it in a TX buffer.  For some applications
	  especially UDP applications, the upper layer can deliver frames faster
	  than WiFi layer can transmit.
	  In these cases, we may run out of TX buffers.

	default 32
	help
	  Set the number of WiFi cache TX buffer number.

	  For each TX packet from uplayer, such as LWIP etc, WiFi driver needs to
	  allocate a static TX buffer and makes a copy of uplayer packet. If WiFi
	  driver fails to allocate the static TX buffer, it caches the uplayer
	  packets to a dedicated buffer queue, this option is used to configure the
	  size of the cached TX queue.

	  If "Dynamic" is selected, each WiFi RX MGMT buffer is allocated as needed when a MGMT data frame is
