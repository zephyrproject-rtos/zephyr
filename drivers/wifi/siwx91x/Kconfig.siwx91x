	  Choose "Native" stack if you want a better compatibility with Zephyr
	  features. "Offloaded" stack may provide better resource (power and
	  memory) consumption.

config WIFI_SILABS_SIWX91X_LIMIT_PACKET_BUF_PER_STA
	bool "Limits the number of packets buffered per STA in AP mode"
	default y
	help
	  In AP mode, if the bit is set, only two packets per Station (STA)
	  would be buffered when the STA is in Power Save (PS) mode.
	  This helps manage buffer usage and ensures efficient packet handling.

config WIFI_SILABS_SIWX91X_ENABLE_ROAMING
	bool "WiFi roaming support"
	default y
	help
	  Enable this option to configure roaming parameters.
	  Roaming will be enabled automatically when the
	  background scan is active, improving connectivity
	  and performance during transitions between access points.

config WIFI_SILABS_SIWX91X_ROAMING_USE_DEAUTH
	bool "Use deauth frames for roaming"
	depends on WIFI_SILABS_SIWX91X_ENABLE_ROAMING
	help
	  Enable this option to allow roaming using
	  deauthentication frames. By default, roaming
	  is performed using Null data packets.

	int "Default value of roam trigger level (in dBm)"
	default -70
	range -100 -10
	depends on WIFI_SILABS_SIWX91X_ENABLE_ROAMING
	help
	  Sets the default roam trigger level. Higher values trigger
	  earlier roaming; lower values delay it. It determines
	  when to start searching for a new AP.

config WIFI_SILABS_SIWX91X_ROAMING_TRIGGER_LEVEL_CHANGE
	int "Default value of roam trigger level change (in dBm)"
	default 5
	range 0 90
	depends on WIFI_SILABS_SIWX91X_ENABLE_ROAMING
	help
	  Configure the default trigger level change for WiFi roaming.
	  This value determines the change in signal strength (in dBm)
	  required to initiate a roaming event. A smaller value may result
	  in more sensitive roaming behavior, while a larger value can
	  reduce the frequency of roaming events. It determines
	  the signal difference needed to switch to a new AP.

config WIFI_SILABS_SIWX91X_ADV_SCAN_THRESHOLD
	int "Advanced scan threshold (in dBm)"
	default -40
	help
	  Configure the default advanced scan threshold for WiFi scanning.
	  This value determines the signal strength (in dBm) below which
	  the advanced scan mechanism will be triggered. Adjust this value
	  to optimize scanning behavior based on your network environment.

config WIFI_SILABS_SIWX91X_ADV_RSSI_TOLERANCE_THRESHOLD
	int "Advanced RSSI tolerance threshold (in dBm)"
	default 5
	help
	  Configure the default RSSI tolerance threshold for advanced WiFi scanning.
	  This value determines the acceptable variation in signal strength (in dBm)
	  during advanced scanning. Adjust this value to fine-tune the sensitivity
	  of the scanning mechanism to signal fluctuations.

config WIFI_SILABS_SIWX91X_ADV_ACTIVE_SCAN_DURATION
	int "Advanced active scan duration (in ms)"
	default 15
	help
	  Configure the default advanced active scan duration for WiFi scanning.
	  This value determines the time (in milliseconds) spent on each
	  channel during an advanced active scan. Adjust this value to optimize
	  scanning speed and accuracy based on your network environment.

config WIFI_SILABS_SIWX91X_ADV_PASSIVE_SCAN_DURATION
	int "Advanced passive scan duration (in ms)"
	default 20
	help
	  Configure the default advanced passive scan duration for WiFi scanning.
	  This value determines the time (in milliseconds) spent on each
	  channel during an advanced passive scan. Adjust this value to optimize
	  scanning speed and accuracy based on your network environment.

config WIFI_SILABS_SIWX91X_ADV_MULTIPROBE
	int "Advanced multiprobe setting"
	default 1
	help
	  Configure the advanced multiprobe setting for WiFi scanning.
	  When set to 1, multiple probe requests will be sent to all access
	  points in addition to the connected SSID during scanning. Adjust
	  this value to fine-tune scanning behavior based on your network
	  requirements.

config WIFI_SILABS_SIWX91X_ADV_SCAN_PERIODICITY
	int "Advanced scan periodicity (in ms)"
	default 10
	help
	  Configure the default advanced scan periodicity for WiFi scanning.
	  This value determines the interval (in milliseconds) between consecutive
	  advanced scans. Adjust this value to balance scanning frequency
	  and power consumption based on your network environment.

config WIFI_SILABS_SIWX91X_ENABLE_INSTANT_SCAN
	int "Instant scan support"
	default 1
	help
	  Enable support to start an advanced scan immediately. When enabled, the device
	  can perform an advanced scan without waiting for the periodic
	  scan interval, enabling quicker detection of available networks.

# Override the WIFI_MGMT_SCAN_SSID_FILT_MAX parameter for the Wi-Fi subsystem.
# This device supports filtering scan results for only one SSID.
