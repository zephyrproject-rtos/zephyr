config NORDIC_QSPI_NOR_INIT_PRIORITY
	int "Init priority"
	default 41
	help
	  Device driver initialization priority.

config NORDIC_QSPI_NOR_FLASH_LAYOUT_PAGE_SIZE
	int "Page size to use for FLASH_LAYOUT feature"
	default 65536
	help
	  When CONFIG_FLASH_PAGE_LAYOUT is used this driver will support
	  that API.  By default the page size corresponds to the block
	  size (65536).  Other option include the sector size (4096).

config NORDIC_QSPI_NOR_STACK_WRITE_BUFFER_SIZE
	int "Size of a stack-based buffer to handle writes not supported by QSPI"
	default 4
	help
	  The QSPI peripheral uses DMA and can only write data that is read
	  from a word-aligned location in RAM. A non-zero value here enables
	  a stack buffer to be used for any source data that does not meet
	  these restrictions. Such data will be copied into this buffer to
	  allow the write to proceed. Multiple transfers will be initiated
	  if the data is larger than the configured size.
	  Must be a multiple of 4. When set to 0, the feature is disabled.

config NORDIC_QSPI_NOR_XIP
	bool "XIP (eXecute in place)"
	depends on SOC_NRF5340_CPUAPP
	help
	  Enable setting up the QSPI NOR driver to allow for execution of code
	  stored in QSPI XIP region. Note that for this functionality to work,
	  the QSPI NOR init priority must be set so that no XIP code in the
	  QSPI NOR flash chip is executed until the driver has been setup.
	  This will also disable power management for the QSPI NOR flash chip.

config NORDIC_QSPI_NOR_TIMEOUT_MS
	int "Timeout for QSPI operations (ms)"
	default 500
	help
	  The QSPI peripheral operation timeout in milliseconds.
	  Primarily intended for long running operations such as
	  a flash sector erase. The 500 ms default allows for
	  most typical NOR flash chips to erase a sector.
