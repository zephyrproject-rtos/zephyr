	  This driver can handle several instances of AT45 family chips that
	  are enabled by specifying devicetree nodes with the "compatible"
	  property set to "atmel,at45" and other required properties like
	  JEDEC ID, chip capacity, block and page size etc. configured
	  accordingly.

	  The driver is only capable of using "power of 2" binary page sizes
	  in those chips and at initialization configures them to work in
	  that mode (unless it is already done).

	help
	  Use the Read-Modify-Write command (opcode 0x58) instead of the default
	  Main Memory Program without Built-In Erase (opcode 0x02). This allows
	  writing of data without prior erasing of corresponding pages.

	  Device driver initialization priority.
	  SPI driver needs to be initialized before this one.
