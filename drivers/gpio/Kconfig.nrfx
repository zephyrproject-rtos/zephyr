	help
	  Enable GPIO edge interrupts implementation using GPIO SENSE, which is
	  a level interrupt mechanism. Conversion from level to edge interrupts
	  notification happens in GPIO driver, so it is transparent to GPIO
	  consumers after switching from GPIOTE mechanism.

	  Use this option as an alternative to GPIOTE event mechanism. According
	  to product specifications and erratas to some nRF MCUs, using GPIOTE
	  results in increased current consumption in System ON Idle and in
	  conjunction with SPI/TWI peripherals. Selecting this option allows to
	  reduce current for those cases.

	  Using this option additionally allows detecting state changes of pins
	  configured as output, which might be handy for some applications.
