	help
	  This is for setting up I3C controller device driver instance
	  and also to perform bus initialization (e.g. dynamic address
	  assignment).

	  Note that this needs to be done before the device driver
	  instances of the connected I2C and I3C devices start
	  initializing those devices. This is because some devices
	  may not be addressable until addresses are assigned by
	  the controller.

	help
	  Blocking i3c calls when I3C_RTIO is enabled are copied into a per driver
	  submission queue. The queue depth determines the number of possible i3c_msg
	  structs that may be in the array given to i3c_transfer. A sensible default
	  is going to be 4 given the device address, register address, and a value
	  to be read or written.

	help
	  Blocking i3c calls when I3C_RTIO is enabled are copied into a per driver

config I3C_RTIO_FALLBACK_MSGS

	default 4
	help
		When RTIO is used with a driver that does not yet implement the submit API
		natively the submissions are converted back to struct i3c_msg values that
		are given to i3c_transfer. This requires some number of msgs be available to convert
		the submissions into on the stack. MISRA rules dictate we must know this in
		advance.

		In all likelihood 4 is going to work for everyone, but in case you do end up with
		an issue where you are using RTIO, your driver does not implement submit natively,
