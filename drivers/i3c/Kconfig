	help
	  This is for setting up I3C controller device driver instance
	  and also to perform bus initialization (e.g. dynamic address
	  assignment).

	  Note that this needs to be done before the device driver
	  instances of the connected I2C and I3C devices start
	  initializing those devices. This is because some devices
	  may not be addressable until addresses are assigned by
	  the controller.

config I3C_INIT_RSTACT

	default y
	help
	  This determines whether the bus initialization routine
	  sends a reset action command to I3C targets.
