 * @brief LoApicIntr.c - Intel Pentium[234] Local APIC/xAPIC driver
 *
 * This module is a driver for the local APIC/xAPIC (Advanced Programmable
 * Interrupt Controller) in P6 (PentiumPro, II, III) family processors
 * and P7 (Pentium4) family processors.  The local APIC/xAPIC is included
 * in selected P6 (PentiumPro, II, III) and P7 (Pentium4) family processors.
 * Beginning with the P6 family processors, the presence or absence of an
 * on-chip local APIC can be detected using the CPUID instruction.  When the
 * CPUID instruction is executed, bit 9 of the feature flags returned in the
 * EDX register indicates the presence (set) or absence (clear) of an on-chip
 * local APIC.
 *
 * The local APIC performs two main functions for the processor:
 *  - It processes local external interrupts that the processor receives at its
 *    interrupt pins and local internal interrupts that software generates.
 *  - It communicates with an external IO APIC
 *    chip.  The external IO APIC receives external interrupt events from
 *    peripheral and direct them to the local APIC.  The IO APIC is
 *    part of Intel's system chip set.
 * The local APIC controls the dispatching of interrupts (to its associated
 * processor) that it receives either locally or from the IO APIC.  It provides
 * facilities for queuing, nesting and masking of interrupts.  It handles the
 * interrupt delivery protocol with its local processor and accesses to APIC
 * registers.
 * A timer on the local APIC allows local generation of interrupts, and
 * local interrupt pins permit local reception of processor-specific interrupts.
 * The local APIC can be disabled and used in conjunction with a standard 8259A
 * style interrupt controller.  Disabling the local APIC can be done in hardware
 * for the Pentium processors or in software for the P6 and P7 (Pentium4) family
 * processors.
 *
 * The local APIC in the Pentium4 processors (called the xAPIC) is an extension
 * of the local APIC found in the P6 family processors.  The primary difference
 * between the APIC architecture and xAPIC architecture is that with Pentium4
 * processors, the local xAPICs and IO xAPIC communicate with one another
 * through the processors system bus; whereas, with the P6 family processors,
 * communication between the local APICs and the IO APIC is handled through a
 * dedicated 3-wire APIC bus.  Also, some of the architectural features of the
 * local APIC have been extended and/or modified in the local xAPIC.
 *
 * This driver contains three routines for use.  They are:
 * _loapic_init() initializes the Local APIC for the interrupt mode chosen.
 * _loapic_enable()/disable() enables / disables the Local APIC.
 *
 * Local APIC is used in the Virtual Wire Mode: delivery mode ExtINT.
 *
 * Virtual Wire Mode is one of three interrupt modes defined by the MP
 * specification.  In this mode, interrupts are generated by the 8259A
 * equivalent PICs (if present) and delivered to the Boot Strap Processor by
 * the local APIC that is programmed to act as a "virtual Wire"; that
 * is, the local APIC is logically indistinguishable from a hardware
 * connection.  This is a uniprocessor compatibility mode.
 *
 * The local and IO APICs support interrupts in the range of 32 to 255.
 * Interrupt priority is implied by its vector, according to the following
 * relationship:  "priority = vector / 16".
 * Here the quotient is rounded down to the nearest integer value to determine
 * the priority, with 1 being the lowest and 15 is the highest.  Because vectors
 * 0 through 31 are reserved for exclusive use by the processor, the priority of
 * user defined interrupts range from 2 to 15.  A value of 15 in the Interrupt
 * Class field of the Task Priority Register (TPR) will mask off all interrupts,
 * which require interrupt service.
 * The P6 family processor's local APIC includes an in-service entry and a
 * holding entry for each priority level.  To avoid losing interrupts, software
 * should allocate no more than 2 interrupt vectors per priority.  The Pentium4
 * processor expands this support of all acceptance of two interrupts per vector
 * rather than per priority level.
