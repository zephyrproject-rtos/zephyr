config PIC
	bool "PIC (i8259)"
	default n
	depends on X86_32

config LOAPIC
	bool "LOAPIC"
	default n
	depends on X86_32
	help
	This option selects local APIC as the interrupt controller.

config IOAPIC
	bool "IOAPIC"
	default n
	depends on X86_32 && LOAPIC
	help
	This option signifies that the target has an IO-APIC device. This
	capability allows IO-APIC-dependent code to be included.

config ARCV2_INTERRUPT_UNIT
	bool "ARCv2 Interrupt Unit"
	default y
	depends on ARC
	help
	The ARCv2 interrupt unit has 16 allocated exceptions associated with
	vectors 0 to 15 and 240 interrupts associated with vectors 16 to 255.
	The interrupt unit is optional in the ARCv2-based processors. When
	building a processor, you can configure the processor to include an
	interrupt unit. The ARCv2 interrupt unit is highly programmable.
