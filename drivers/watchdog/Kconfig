	help
	  Watchdog emulated with counter device. If counter device supports using
	  zero latency interrupts (ZLI) then expiration callback can be called from
	  that context. This watchdog can be used along hardware watchdog to
	  overcome hardware  watchdog limitations, e.g. Nordic devices reset
	  unconditionally at fixed time after hitting watchdog interrupt, leaving
	  no time to print debug information. Watchdog has limitations since it
	  cannot interrupt same or higher priorities so it cannot fully replace
	  hardware based watchdog.

if WDT_COUNTER

	default 4
	range 1 $(UINT8_MAX)
	help
	  Note that actual channel count will be limited to number of channels
	  supported by the counter device which is used for watchdog.
