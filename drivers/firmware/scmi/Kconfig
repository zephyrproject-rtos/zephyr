	help
	  Enable this if the SCMI transport layer uses static channels.
	  What this means is that each protocol will have its channels
	  assigned at compile time. This option is recommended for
	  transport layer drivers which can use the default channel
	  allocation scheme (i.e: use protocol-specific channels if
	  they exist, otherwise use base protocol channels).

config ARM_SCMI_TRANSPORT_INIT_PRIORITY
	int "SCMI transport layer initialization priority"
	default 20
	help
	  SCMI transport driver device initialization priority.
