if CONSOLE

config CONSOLE_INPUT_MAX_LINE_LEN
	int "Console maximum input line length"
	default 128
	help
	  This option can be used to modify the maximum length a console input
	  can be.

config CONSOLE_HAS_DRIVER
	bool
	help
	  This is an option to be enabled by console drivers to signal
	  that some kind of console exists.

config CONSOLE_HANDLER
	bool "Console input handler"
	depends on UART_CONSOLE && SERIAL_SUPPORT_INTERRUPT
	select UART_INTERRUPT_DRIVEN
	help
	  This option enables console input handler allowing to write simple
	  interaction between serial console and the OS.

config CONSOLE_INIT_PRIORITY
	int "Console init priority"
	default 95 if UART_MUX
	default 60 if UART_CONSOLE || XTENSA_SIM_CONSOLE
	default KERNEL_INIT_PRIORITY_DEFAULT
	help
	  Console driver device initialization priority.

config UART_CONSOLE
	bool "Use UART for console"
	depends on SERIAL && SERIAL_HAS_DRIVER
	select CONSOLE_HAS_DRIVER
	help
	  Enable this option to use one UART for console.

config UART_CONSOLE_DEBUG_SERVER_HOOKS
	bool "Debug server hooks in debug console"
	depends on UART_CONSOLE
	help
	  This option allows a debug server agent such as GDB to take over the
	  handling of traffic that goes through the console logic. The debug
	  server looks at characters received and decides to handle them itself if
	  they are some sort of control characters, or let the regular console
	  code handle them if they are of no special significance to it.

config UART_CONSOLE_MCUMGR
	bool "UART console mcumgr passthrough"
	depends on UART_CONSOLE
	help
	  Enables the UART console to receive mcumgr frames for image upgrade
	  and device management.  When enabled, the UART console does not
	  process mcumgr frames, but it hands them up to a higher level module
	  (e.g., the shell).  If unset, incoming mcumgr frames are dropped.

config UART_CONSOLE_INPUT_EXPIRED
	bool "Support for UART console input expired mechanism"
	default y
	depends on UART_CONSOLE && PM
	help
	  This option allows a notification to the power management module that
	  the module for UART console is in use now. If the interval of console
	  module doesn't receive any input message exceeds expired timeout, such
	  as UART_CONSOLE_INPUT_EXPIRED_TIMEOUT, the power management module is
	  allowed to enter sleep/deep sleep state and turn off the clock of UART
	  console module. This mechanism gives a window in which the users can
	  organize input message if CONFIG_PM is enabled.

config UART_CONSOLE_INPUT_EXPIRED_TIMEOUT
	int "Fixed amount of time to keep the UART console in use flag true"
	default 15000
	depends on UART_CONSOLE_INPUT_EXPIRED
	help
	  Fixed amount of time which unit is milliseconds to keep the UART
	  console in use flag true.

	bool "Use JAILHOUSE_DEBUG console"
	select CONSOLE_HAS_DRIVER
	depends on ARM64
	help
	  Emit console messages to a jailhouse hypervisor debug console.
	  Useful in board bring-up if there aren't any working serial
	  drivers.

config RAM_CONSOLE
	bool "Use RAM console"
	select CONSOLE_HAS_DRIVER
	help
	  Emit console messages to a RAM buffer "ram_console" which can
	  be examined at runtime with a debugger. Useful in board bring-up
	  if there aren't any working serial drivers.

config RAM_CONSOLE_BUFFER_SIZE
	int "Ram Console buffer size"
	default 1024
	depends on RAM_CONSOLE
	help
	  Size of the RAM console buffer. Messages will wrap around if the
	  length is exceeded.

	depends on USE_SEGGER_RTT
	select CONSOLE_HAS_DRIVER
	help
	  Emit console messages to a RAM buffer that is then read by the
	  Segger J-Link software and displayed on a computer in real-time.
	  Requires support for Segger J-Link on the companion IC onboard.

config RTT_TX_RETRY_CNT
	int "Number of TX retries"
	default 2
	help
	  Number of TX retries before dropping the byte and assuming that
	  RTT session is inactive.

config RTT_TX_RETRY_DELAY_MS
	int "Delay between TX retries in milliseconds"
	default 2
	help
	  Sleep period between TX retry attempts. During RTT session, host pulls data
	  periodically. Period starts from 1-2 milliseconds and can be increased
	  if traffic on RTT increases (also from host to device). In case of
	  heavy traffic data can be lost and it may be necessary to increase
	  delay or number of retries.

config RTT_TX_RETRY_IN_INTERRUPT
	bool "Busy wait in the interrupt context for TX retry"
	help
	  If enabled RTT console will busy wait between TX retries when console
	  assumes that RTT session is active. In case of heavy traffic data can
	  be lost and it may be necessary to increase delay or number of
	  retries.

	help
	  Enable pipe UART driver. This driver allows application to communicate
	  over UART with custom defined protocol. Driver doesn't inspect received
	  data (as contrary to console UART driver) and all aspects of received
	  protocol data are handled by application provided callback.
