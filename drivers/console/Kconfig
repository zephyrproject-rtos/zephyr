menuconfig CONSOLE

	prompt "Console drivers"

if CONSOLE

config CONSOLE_HAS_DRIVER
	bool
	default n
	help
	This is an option to be enabled by console drivers to signal
	that some kind of console exists.

config CONSOLE_HANDLER
	bool
	prompt "Enable console input handler"
	depends on UART_CONSOLE
	select UART_INTERRUPT_DRIVEN
	default n
	help
	This option enables console input handler allowing to write simple
	interaction between serial console and the OS.

config CONSOLE_HANDLER_SHELL
	bool
	prompt "Enable console input handler [ Experimental ]"
	default n
	depends on CONSOLE_HANDLER
	help
	Shell implementation based on CONSOLE_HANDLER.

config CONSOLE_HANDLER_SHELL_STACKSIZE
	int
	prompt "Console handler shell stack size"
	default 2000
	depends on CONSOLE_HANDLER_SHELL
	help
	Stack size for the console handler shell.

config UART_CONSOLE
	bool
	prompt "Use UART for console"
	default n
	depends on SERIAL && SERIAL_HAS_DRIVER
	select CONSOLE_HAS_DRIVER
	help
	Enable this option to use one UART for console. Make sure
	CONFIG_UART_CONSOLE_ON_DEV_NAME is also set correctly.

config UART_CONSOLE_ON_DEV_NAME
	string "Device Name of UART Device for UART Console"
	default "UART_0"
	depends on UART_CONSOLE
	help
	This option specifies the name of UART device to be used for
	UART console.

config UART_CONSOLE_IRQ
	int "IRQ of UART Device for UART Console"
	depends on UART_CONSOLE
	help
	This option specifies the IRQ of UART device to be used for
	UART console.

config UART_CONSOLE_IRQ_PRI
	int "IRQ of UART Device for UART Console"
	depends on UART_CONSOLE
	help
	This option specifies the IRQ priorityof UART device to be
	used for UART console.

config UART_CONSOLE_PRIORITY
	int
	prompt "Init priority"
	depends on UART_CONSOLE
	help
	  Device driver initialization priority.
	  Console has to be initialized after the UART driver
	  it uses.

config RAM_CONSOLE
	bool
	prompt "Use RAM console"
	select CONSOLE_HAS_DRIVER
	default n
	help
	Emit console messages to a RAM buffer "ram_console" which can
	be examined at runtime with a debugger. Useful in board bring-up
	if there aren't any working serial drivers.

config RAM_CONSOLE_BUFFER_SIZE
	int "Ram Console buffer size"
	default 1024
	depends on RAM_CONSOLE
	help
	Size of the RAM console buffer. Messages will wrap around if the
	length is exceeded.

config IPM_CONSOLE_SENDER
	bool
	prompt "Inter-processor Mailbox console sender"
	select CONSOLE_HAS_DRIVER
	default n
	help
	Enable the sending side of IPM console

config IPM_CONSOLE_RECEIVER
	bool
	prompt "Inter-processor Mailbox console receiver"
	select RING_BUFFER
	default n
	help

config IPM_CONSOLE_PRIORITY
	int
	prompt "IPM console init priority"
	default 60
	depends on IPM_CONSOLE_SENDER || IPM_CONSOLE_RECEIVER
	help
	  Device driver initialization priority.
	  Console has to be initialized after the IPM subsystem
	  it uses.

config	UART_PIPE
	bool
	prompt "Enable pipe UART driver"
	select UART_INTERRUPT_DRIVEN
	default n
	help
	Enable pipe UART driver. This driver allows application to communicate
	over UART with custom defined protocol. Driver doesn't inspect received
	data (as contrary to console UART driver) and all aspects of received
	protocol data are handled by application provided callback.

config  UART_PIPE_ON_DEV_NAME
	string "Device Name of UART Device for pipe UART"
	default "UART_0"
	depends on UART_PIPE
	help
	This option specifies the name of UART device to be used
	for pipe UART.

config  UART_PIPE_IRQ
	int "IRQ for pipe UART"

	help
	This option specifies the IRQ of UART device to be used
	for pipe UART.

config  UART_PIPE_IRQ_PRI
	int "IRQ Priority for pipe UART"
	depends on UART_PIPE
	help

	to be used for pipe UART.
