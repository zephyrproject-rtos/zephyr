	  SYSCON (System Controller) drivers. System controller node represents
	  a register region containing a set of miscellaneous registers. The
	  registers are not cohesive enough to represent as any specific type
	  of device. The typical use-case is for some other node's driver, or
	  platform-specific code, to acquire a reference to the syscon node and
	  extract information from there.

	  This option controls the priority of the syscon device

	  initialized earlier in the startup cycle. If unsure, leave at default
