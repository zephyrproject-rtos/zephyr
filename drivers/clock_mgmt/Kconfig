	  Enable support for clock management drivers. These drivers provide
	  clock configuration to the system via a series of setpoints, which
	  allow drivers to configure clocks based on their desired power
	  state

config CLOCK_MGMT_SET_RATE
	bool "Support runtime rate setting"
	help
	  Allow clock consumers to request a given clock frequency via the
	  clock management framework. The framework will then configure the
	  clock tree so that the consumer is supplied with the closest
	  possible frequency to its request. Note that enabling this feature
	  will result in increased flash utilization

config CLOCK_MGMT_NOTIFY
	bool "Support clock rate change notifications"
	help
	  Support clock rate change notifications. When enabled, clock
	  consumers can register for a callback when the frequency of their
	  output clock changes.
