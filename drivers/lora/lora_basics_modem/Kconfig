	  The packet RSSI is the strength of the signal in the configured band.
	  Once the LoRa signal goes below the noise floor, this value with stay
	  at the signal strength of the noise floor.

	  The signal RSSI is an estimate of the strength of the received LoRa
	  signal. In contrast to the packet RSSI, this value will continue to
	  decrease below the noise floor as the signal approaches the sensitivity
	  limits of the receiver.
