config QMSI_DRIVERS
	depends on CPU_MINUTEIA
	bool "Enable QMSI drivers"
	default n
	help
	This option enables QMSI device drivers. These drivers are actually shim
	drivers based on drivers provided by QMSI BSP. The BSP provides a static
	library (libqmsi) which implements several drivers for peripherals from
	Intel MCUs (e.g. Quark SE and Quark D2000).

config QMSI_INSTALL_PATH
	depends on QMSI_DRIVERS
	string "QMSI install path"
	help
	This option holds the path where the QMSI library and headers are
	installed. Make sure this option is properly set when QMSI_DRIVERS
	is enabled otherwise the build will fail.
