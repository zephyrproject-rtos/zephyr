	string "UART device name the PPP is connected to"

config NET_PPP_DRV_NAME
	string "PPP Driver name"
	default "ppp"
	help
	  This option sets the driver name

config NET_PPP_UART_BUF_LEN
	int "Buffer length when reading from UART"
	default 8
	help
	  This options sets the size of the UART buffer where data
	  is being read to.

config NET_PPP_RINGBUF_SIZE
	int "PPP ring buffer size"
	default 256
	help
	  PPP ring buffer size when passing data from RX ISR to worker
	  thread that will pass the data to IP stack.

config NET_PPP_RX_STACK_SIZE
	int "Size of the stack allocated for receiving data from modem"
	default 768
	help
	  Sets the stack size which will be used by the PPP RX workqueue.

config NET_PPP_RX_PRIORITY
	int "RX workqueue thread priority"
	default 7
	help
	  Sets the priority of the RX workqueue thread.

config NET_PPP_VERIFY_FCS
	bool "Verify that received FCS is valid"
	default y
	help
	  If you have a reliable link, then it might make sense
	  to disable this as it takes some time to verify the received
	  packet.

config PPP_MAC_ADDR
	string "MAC address for the interface"
	help
	  Specify a MAC address for the PPP interface in the form of
	  six hex 8-bit chars separated by colons (e.g.:
	  aa:33:cc:22:e2:c0).  The default is an empty string, which
	  means the code will make 00:00:5E:00:53:XX, where XX will be
	  random.
