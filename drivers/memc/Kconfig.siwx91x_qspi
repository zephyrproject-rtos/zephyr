	  If you want to rely on the linker to place symbols in this memory
	  (using`zephyr_code_relocate() or Z_GENERIC_SECTION()), you have to
	  ensure this driver in initialized before KERNEL_INIT_PRIORITY_OBJECTS
	  (=30). In addition, this driver may depends on a clock. Then, you have
	  to ensure the clock will be started before this driver (see
	  CLOCK_CONTROL_INIT_PRIORITY)
