	  Enable driver for SEN6x environmental sensor.

	  The sensor does not have an interrupt pin, but it's status registers
	  are being made available through other means:
	  - Every time data is read, the driver checks if the data has actually
	    changed. This information can be retrieved using the decoders
	    has_trigger API with the SENSOR_TRIG_DATA_READY trigger.
	  - You can register a status callback with the driver to get notified
	    about sensor errors. If any callbacks are registered, the status
	    register is read and callbacks are triggered on every call to the
	    sensors submit function.
	    The driver allows submitting a read with 0 channels, to poll just
	    the status.
