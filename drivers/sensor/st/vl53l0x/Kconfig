	  Threshold used for proximity detection when sensor is used with SENSOR_CHAN_PROX.

config VL53L0X_RECONFIGURE_ADDRESS
	bool "Support reconfigurable sensor address"
	depends on VL53L0X
	help
	  Enable support for reconfiguring the sensor address at runtime.
	  When this option is enabled, all sensors declared in the device tree
	  must have an xshut-gpio property.

	  All sensors are disabled during initialization. When reading the first
	  value from a sensor, it is powered up and its I2C address is reconfigured
	  from the manufacturer default (0x29) to the address specified in the
	  device tree.
