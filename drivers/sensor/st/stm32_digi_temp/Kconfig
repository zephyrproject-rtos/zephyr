	  Enable the driver for STM32 digital temperature sensor. This sensor
	  is different from the STM32 analog temperature sensor, which is read
	  by an ADC. While both drivers have similar code footprint, the analog
	  temperature driver also requires the ADC driver to be enabled. The
	  sensors differ in precision, accuracy and power consumption. Users
	  are encouraged to consult the datasheet to select the sensor that
	  best suits their needs.
