  timer:
    name: "timer"
    description: >
      Timer-based trigger, useful when the sensor does not have an interrupt
      line.
  data_ready:
    name: " data ready"
    description: "Trigger fires whenever new data is ready."
  delta:

    description: >
      Trigger fires when the selected channel varies significantly.
      This includes any-motion detection when the channel is
      acceleration or gyro. If detection is based on slope between
      successive channel readings, the slope threshold is configured
      via the @ref SENSOR_ATTR_SLOPE_TH and @ref SENSOR_ATTR_SLOPE_DUR
      attributes.
  near_far:
    name: "near/far"
    description: "Trigger fires when a near/far event is detected."
  threshold:
    name: "threshold reached"
    description: >
      Trigger fires when channel reading transitions configured
      thresholds.  The thresholds are configured via the @ref
      SENSOR_ATTR_LOWER_THRESH, @ref SENSOR_ATTR_UPPER_THRESH, and
      @ref SENSOR_ATTR_HYSTERESIS attributes.
  tap:
    name: "tap"
    description: "Trigger fires when a single tap is detected."
  double_tap:
    name: "double tap"
    description: "Trigger fires when a double tap is detected."
  freefall:
    name: "free fall"
    description: "Trigger fires when a free fall is detected."
  motion:
    name: "motion"
    description: "Trigger fires when motion is detected."
  stationary:
    name: "stationary"
    description: "Trigger fires when no motion has been detected for a while."
  fifo_watermark:
    name: "FIFO watermark"
    description: "Trigger fires when the FIFO watermark has been reached."
  fifo_full:
    name: "FIFO full"
    description: "Trigger fires when the FIFO becomes full."
