	  This driver is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
	  It is currently scheduled to be removed in Zephyr 4.6.
	  We will implement a new LPCMP driver based on the comparator driver
	  API and enable test cases for boards/SoCs that previously supported
	  the mcux_lpcmp driver and sample.
