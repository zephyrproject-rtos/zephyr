	  Enable shunt voltage measurement for INA226.

	  This is the actual shunt voltage measured which is scaled within the
	  INA226 based upon the SHUNT_CAL register. This value is useful for
	  determining the measurement noise or debugging the SHUNT_CAL value.

	  Note that enabling this option requires an extra I2C read when the
	  SENSOR_CHAN_ALL is selected. Hence, only enable this option if the
	  shunt voltage measurement is required.
