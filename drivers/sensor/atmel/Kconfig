config M90EXX_ROBUSTNESS_WORKAROUND
	bool "Atmel M90EXX robustness workaround"
	default n
	depends on M90E32AS || M90E26
	help
	Enable workaround for robustness issues in Atmel M90EXX series energy metering ICs.

	This option enables additional checks and error handling to improve the reliability
	of communication with the M90EXX devices, which may be prone to transient faults
	under certain conditions.

	At read/write operations, the driver will implement retries and validation
	mechanisms to ensure data integrity. This may introduce slight performance overhead,
	but significantly enhances robustness in noisy environments.

	If unsure, it is recommended to enable this option.

config M90EXX_SHELL
	bool "Atmel M90EXX Shell Commands"
	default n
	depends on SHELL && (M90E32AS || M90E26)
	help
	Enable shell commands for interacting with Atmel M90EXX series energy metering ICs.

	This option adds a set of shell commands that allow users to query and configure
	M90EXX devices directly from the Zephyr shell interface. It is useful for debugging,
	testing, and manual configuration of the energy metering ICs.
