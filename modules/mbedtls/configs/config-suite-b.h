/*
 * Minimal configuration for TLS NSA Suite B Profile (RFC 6460)
 *
 * Distinguishing features:
 * - no RSA or classic DH, fully based on ECC
 * - optimized for low RAM usage
 *
 * Possible improvements:
 * - if 128-bit security is enough, disable secp384r1 and SHA-512
 * - use embedded certs in DER format and disable PEM_PARSE_C and BASE64_C
 *
 * See README.txt for usage instructions.
