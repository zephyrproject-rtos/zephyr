This folder holds an exact copy of the Babblesim manifest,
as pointed by the top level manifest bsim project.

This is a provisional solution until some new features in west enable a more
automatic integration.

Background:
**********

Due to a limitation in the west import feature
https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/west/issues/543
a project cannot both have an import and be part of a group.

Moreover, when a project has an import and is not filtered out, it is required
for that project to be present for most west commands to work.

To work around this issue, we do not do an import in the bsim project, that is,
we do not have west automatically find the babblesim manifest inside the bsim
project, but instead import the manifest from this local replica.

This manifest is kept in a subfolder of the submanifests folder, so the placing
of its projects can be individually controlled with the west import path-prefix
property.

The bsim project as included in the top level manifest has two purposes:
 * It provides a skeleton and some glue for the BabbleSim installation, if the user
   enables the babblesim group.
 * It is the bsim manifest revision Zephyr's CI will use.
