LSM6DSO: IMU Sensor Monitor (I2C on I3C bus)
############################################

Overview
********
This sample sets the date rate of LSM6DSO accelerometer and gyroscope to
12.5Hz and enables a trigger on data ready. It displays on the console
the values for accelerometer and gyroscope.

Requirements
************

This sample uses the LSM6DSO sensor controlled using the I2C interface
exposed by the I3C controller. It has been tested using the LSM6DSO on
the evaluation board STEVAL-MKI196V1 connected to the I3C header
on :ref:`mimxrt685_evk`.

Building and Running
********************

This project outputs sensor data to the console. It requires an LSM6DSO
sensor (for example, the one on evaluation board STEVAL-MKI196V1).

Building on mimxrt685_evk board
====================================

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/sensor/lsm6dso_i2c_on_i3c
   :host-os: unix
   :board: mimxrt685_evk/mimxrt685s/cm33
   :goals: build
   :compact:

Board Preparations
==================

mimxrt685_evk
------------------

On the board :ref:`mimxrt685_evk`, the I3C pins are exposed on the J18
header, where:

  * SCL is on pin 1
  * SDA is on pin 2
  * Internal pull-up is on pin 3 (which is connected to pin 2 already)
  * Ground is on pin4

LSM6DSO
^^^^^^^

A LSM6DSO sensor needs to be connected to this header. For example,
the evaluation board STEVAL-MKI196V1 can be used. This needs to be
prepared so that the LSM6DSO sensor has address 0x6B (i.e. 0xD6,
left-shifed).
