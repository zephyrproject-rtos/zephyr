LPS22HH: Temperature and Pressure Monitor
#########################################

Overview
********
This sample periodically reads pressure from the LPS22HH MEMS pressure
sensor and displays it on the console.


Requirements
************

This sample uses the LPS22HH sensor controlled using the I2C interface.

Building and Running
********************

This project outputs sensor data to the console. It requires an LPS22HH
sensor, which is present on the X-NUCLEO-IKS01A3 shield.
