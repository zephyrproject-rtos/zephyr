Generic Proximity Sensor Sample
###############################

Overview
********

This sample demonstrates how to use one or multiple proximity sensors.

Building and Running
********************

The sample supports up to 10 proximity sensors. The number of the sensors will
automatically detected from the devicetree, you only need to set aliases from
``prox-sensor-0`` to ``prox-sensor-9``.

For example:

.. code-block:: devicetree

   / {
              aliases {
                      prox-sensor0 = &tmd2620;
              };
   };

After creating the devicetree overlay you can build the sample with:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/sensor/proximity_polling
   :board: <your_board>
   :goals: build flash
   :compact:
