CCS811 Indoor Air Quality Sensor
################################

Overview
********

The CCS811 digital gas sensor detects volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
for indoor air quality measurements. VOCs are often categorized as
pollutants and/or sensory irritants and can come from a variety of
sources such as construction materials (paint and carpet), machines
(copiers and processors), and even people (breathing and smoking).  It
estimates carbon dioxide (CO2) levels where the main source of VOCs is
human presence.

Sample Output
=============

The sample output below is from a `Nordic Thingy:52
<https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Prototyping-platforms/Nordic-Thingy-52>`_
(thingy52/nrf52832) that includes this sensor (and others).
After a soft reset, there is a 5-second startup period
where readings are unstable, and then we can see steady
reported measurements of about 400 ppm eC02 and 0 ppb eTVOC.
