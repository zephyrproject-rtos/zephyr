MAX30101 Heart Rate Sensor
##########################

Overview
********

A sensor application that demonstrates how to poll data from the max30101 heart
rate sensor.

Building and Running
********************

This project configures the max30101 sensor on the :ref:`hexiwear` board to
enable the green LED and measure the reflected light with a photodiode. The raw
ADC data prints to the console. Further processing (not included in this
sample) is required to extract a heart rate signal from the light measurement.
