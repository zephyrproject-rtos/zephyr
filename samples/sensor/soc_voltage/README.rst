SoC voltage sensor measurement
##############################

Overview
********

This sample reads one or more of the various voltage sensors an SoC might have and
displays the results.

Building and Running
********************

In order to run this sample, enable the sensor node that supports
``SENSOR_CHAN_VOLTAGE`` and create an alias named ``volt-sensor0`` to link to the node.
The tail ``0`` is the sensor number.  This sample support up to 16 sensors.
