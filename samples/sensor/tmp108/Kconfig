config APP_REPORT_TEMP_ALERTS
	bool "Report over and under temperature alerts"
	default n

config APP_ENABLE_ONE_SHOT
	bool "One shot low power mode"
	default n
	help
		One shot requires a callback to be invoked after the tmp108 has
		woken up and taken a temperature reading, calling sample_fetch
		starts this process. Set this to enable 1 shot mode example.

	int "RH [%] high threshold for alert trigger in celsius"
	range 0 50
	default 26
	help
		Set this to enable alerts for high temperatures
		although this will work with one shot enabled,
		it requires continuous monitoring mode to be enabled
		to work in real time.
		See spec sheet for more details.

	int "RH [%] low threshold for alert trigger in celsius"
	range 0 50
	default 18
