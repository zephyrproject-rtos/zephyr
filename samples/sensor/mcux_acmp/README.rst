   :name: NXP MCUX Analog Comparator (ACMP)
   :relevant-api: sensor_interface

   Get analog comparator data from an NXP MCUX Analog Comparator (ACMP).

Overview
********

This sample show how to use the NXP MCUX Analog Comparator (ACMP) driver. The
sample supports the :zephyr:board:`twr_ke18f`, :zephyr:board:`mimxrt1170_evk`, :zephyr:board:`frdm_ke17z`
, :zephyr:board:`frdm_ke17z512` and :zephyr:board:`mimxrt1180_evk`.

The input voltage for the negative input of the analog comparator is
provided by the ACMP Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC). The input voltage for
the positive input can be adjusted by turning the on-board potentiometer for
:zephyr:board:`twr_ke18f` board, for :zephyr:board:`mimxrt1170_evk` the voltage signal is
captured on J25-13, the :zephyr:board:`frdm_ke17z` and :zephyr:board:`frdm_ke17z512` boards are
captured in J2-3, the :zephyr:board:`mimxrt1180_evk` board are captured in J45-13, need
change the external voltage signal to check the output.

The output value of the analog comparator is reported on the console.

Building and Running
