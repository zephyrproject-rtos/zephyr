config READ_MEASUREMENT_VALUES
	bool "Build sample for reading measurement values"
	default n
	help
	  Build the sample application for reading measurement values from the
	  PZEM004T sensor. This sample demonstrates how to read and display
	  various measurement values such as voltage, current, power, and energy.

config READ_SENSOR_PARAMETERS
	bool "Build sample for reading sensor parameters"
	default n
	help
	  Build the sample application for reading sensor parameters from the
	  PZEM004T sensor. This sample demonstrates how to read and display
	  sensor parameters power alarm threshold and modbus rtu address.

config SET_SENSOR_PARAMETERS
	bool "Build sample for setting sensor parameters"
	default n
	help
	  Build the sample application for setting sensor parameters on the
	  PZEM004T sensor. This sample demonstrates how to set sensor parameters
	  such as power alarm threshold and modbus rtu modbus address.

config RESET_ENERGY
	bool "Build sample for setting sensor parameters"
	default n
	help
	  Build the sample application for resetting energy on the
	  PZEM004T sensor. This sample demonstrates how to reset the energy
	  counter on the sensor.
