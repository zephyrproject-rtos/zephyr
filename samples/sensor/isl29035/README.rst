ISL29035: Digital Light Sensor
##############################

Overview
********

If trigger is not enabled the sample displays measured light intensity
every 2 seconds.

If trigger is enabled the sample displays light intensity from the
ISL29035 sensor every 10 seconds if it is within +/- 50 lux of the last
read sample.  If the sensor detects an intensity outside that range the
application wakes, displays the intensity, resets the intensity range
window to center on the new value, then continues as before.

Requirements
************

This sample uses an external breakout for the sensor.  A devicetree
overlay must be provided to connect the sensor to the I2C bus and
identify the interrupt signal.
