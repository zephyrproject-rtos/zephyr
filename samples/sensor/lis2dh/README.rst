LIS2DH: Motion Sensor Monitor
#############################

Overview
********

This sample application periodically reads accelerometer data from the
LIS2DH sensor (or the compatible LS2DH12, LIS3DH, and LSM303DLHC
sensors), and displays the sensor data on the console.

Requirements
************

This sample uses the LIS2DH, ST MEMS system-in-package featuring a 3D
digital output motion sensor.

Building and Running
********************

The LIS2DH2 or compatible sensors are available on a variety of boards
and shields supported by Zephyr, including:

* :ref:`actinius_icarus`
* :ref:`thingy52_nrf52832`
* :ref:`stm32f3_disco_board`
* :ref:`x-nucleo-iks01a2`

See the board documentation for detailed instructions on how to flash
and get access to the console where acceleration data is displayed.

Building on actinius_icarus
===========================

:ref:`actinius_icarus` includes an ST LIS2DH12 accelerometer which
supports the LIS2DH interface.

Building on nucleo_l476rg with IKS01A2 shield
=============================================

The :ref:`x-nucleo-iks01a2` includes an LSM303AGR accelerometer which
supports the LIS2DH interface.  This shield may also be used on other
boards with Arduino headers.
