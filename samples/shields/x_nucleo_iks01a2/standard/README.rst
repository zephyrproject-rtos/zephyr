   :name: X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 shield - Standard (Mode 1)
   :relevant-api: sensor_interface

   Interact with all the sensors of an X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 shield using Standard Mode.

Overview
********
This sample enables all sensors of a X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 shield, and then
periodically reads and displays data from the shield sensors:

- HTS221: Ambient temperature and relative humidity
- LPS22HB: Atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature
- LSM6DSL: 3-Axis Acceleration and 3-Axis Angular Velocity
- LSM303AGR 3-Axis Acceleration and 3-axis Magnetic field intensity

Requirements
************

This sample communicates over I2C with the X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 shield
stacked on a board with an Arduino connector. The board's I2C must be
configured for the I2C Arduino connector in the devicetree. See for
example the :ref:`nucleo_f401re_board` board source code:

- :zephyr_file:`boards/st/nucleo_f401re/nucleo_f401re.dts`
- :zephyr_file:`boards/st/nucleo_f401re/arduino_r3_connector.dtsi`

Please note that this sample can't be used with boards already supporting
one of the sensors available on the shield (such as disco_l475_iot1) as zephyr
does not yet support sensors multiple instances.

Building and Running
********************

This sample runs with X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 stacked on any board with a matching
Arduino connector. For this example, we use a :ref:`nucleo_f401re_board` board.
