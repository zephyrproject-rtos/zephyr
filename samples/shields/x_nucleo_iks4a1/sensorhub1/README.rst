X-NUCLEO-IKS4A1 shield SHUB1 (Mode 3) sample
############################################

Overview
********
This sample is provided as an example to test the X-NUCLEO-IKS4A1 shield
configured in SHUB1 (Mode 3).
Please refer to :ref:`x-nucleo-iks4a1-mode-3` for more info on this configuration.

This sample enables LSM6DSV16X IMU in sensorhub mode with LIS2MDL magnetometer and
LPS22DF pressure and temperature sensor.

Then sensor data are displayed periodically

- LSM6DSV16X 6-Axis acceleration and angular velocity
- LSM6DSV16X (from LIS2MDL) 3-Axis magnetic field intensity
- LSM6DSV16X (from LPS22DF) ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure

Requirements
************

This sample communicates over I2C with the X-NUCLEO-IKS4A1 shield
stacked on a board with an Arduino connector, e.g. the
:ref:`nucleo_f411re_board` board.

Building and Running
********************

This sample runs with X-NUCLEO-IKS4A1 stacked on any board with a matching
Arduino connector. For this example, we use a :ref:`nucleo_f411re_board` board.
