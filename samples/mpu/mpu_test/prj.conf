CONFIG_CONSOLE_SHELL=y

### In order to allow the flash device to be written to, this line will
### need to be uncommented.  Note that on some devices (MCUX/NXP), this
### needs to be enabled to even enable CONFIG_FLASH, as the probe needs
### to write to flash.  Also, on NXP, enabling flash write also requires
### that execute from RAM be enabled, as this is needed to operate the
### flash device.
# CONFIG_MPU_ALLOW_FLASH_WRITE=y
# CONFIG_FLASH=y

### These can be uncommented to enable the flash device on the
### STM32F4X devices.
