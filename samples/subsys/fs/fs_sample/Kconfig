	  In case when no files could be listed, because there are none,
	  "some.dir" directory and "other.txt" file will be created
	  and list will run again to show them. This is useful when
	  showing how file system works on non-SD devices like internal
	  flash or (Q)SPI connected memories, where it is not possible to
	  easily add files with use of other device.
