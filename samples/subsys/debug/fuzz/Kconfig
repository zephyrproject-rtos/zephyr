config ARCH_POSIX_FUZZ_IRQ
	int "OS interrupt via which to deliver fuzz cases"
	default 31
	help
	  In this sample, new fuzz cases are delivered to Zephyr
	  via interrupts.  The IRQ should be otherwise unused, but can
	  be any value desired by the app.

config ARCH_POSIX_FUZZ_TICKS
	int "Ticks to allow for fuzz case processing"
	default 2
	help
	  Fuzz interrupts are delivered, from the perspective of the
	  OS, at a steady cadence in simulated time.  In general most
	  apps won't require much time to reach an idle state
	  following a unit-test style case, so the default is short to
	  prevent interaction with regular timer workloads.
