.. zephyr:code-sample:: cmsis-rtos-v1-sync
   :name: Synchronization using CMSIS RTOS V1 APIs

   Use timers and message queues from CMSIS RTOS v1 API to synchronize threads.

Overview
********
The sample project illustrates usage of timers and message queues using
CMSIS RTOS V1 APIs.

The main thread creates a preemptive thread which writes message to message queue
and on timer expiry, message is read by main thread.
