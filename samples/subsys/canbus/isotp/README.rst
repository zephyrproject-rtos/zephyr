.. zephyr:code-sample:: isotp
   :name: ISO-TP library
   :relevant-api: can_isotp

   Use ISO-TP library to exchange messages between two boards.

Overview
********
This sample demonstrates how to use the :ref:`ISO-TP library <can_isotp>`.

Messages are exchanged between two boards. A long message, that is sent with
a block-size (BS) of eight frames, and a short one that has a minimal
separation-time (STmin) of five milliseconds.

The send function call for the short message is non-blocking, and the send
function call for the long message is blocking.

Building and Running
********************
Use these instructions with integrated CAN controller like in the NXP TWR-KE18F
or Nucleo-F746ZG board.

For the NXP TWR-KE18F board:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/subsys/canbus/isotp
   :board: twr_ke18f
   :goals: build flash

Requirements
************

* Two boards with CAN bus support, connected together
