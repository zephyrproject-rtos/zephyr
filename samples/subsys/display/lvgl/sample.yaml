    # flash usage varies depending on the platform, but ~200K are the bare
    # minimum, give some room by adding 50K more. RAM usage depends largerly on
    # the display buffer, but a minimum is also required for the system itself.
    # ~25K seem to be sufficient for most cases, rounded to 32K.
