.. zephyr:code-sample:: openamp
   :name: OpenAMP
   :relevant-api: ipm_interface

   Send messages between two cores using OpenAMP.

Overview
********

This application demonstrates how to use OpenAMP with Zephyr. It is designed to
demonstrate how to integrate OpenAMP with Zephyr both from a build perspective
and code. Note that the remote and primary core images can be flashed
independently, but sysbuild must be used in order to build the images.

Open a serial terminal (minicom, putty, etc.) and connect the board with the
following settings:

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1

Reset the board and the following message will appear on the corresponding
serial port, one is master another is remote:
