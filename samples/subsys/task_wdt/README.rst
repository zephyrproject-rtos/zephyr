.. zephyr:code-sample:: task-wdt
   :name: Task watchdog
   :relevant-api: task_wdt_api

   Monitor a thread using a task watchdog.

Overview
********

This sample allows to test the :ref:`task watchdog <task_wdt_api>` subsystem.

Building and Running
********************

It should be possible to build and run the task watchdog sample on almost any
board. If a hardware watchdog is defined in the devicetree, it is used as a
fallback. Otherwise the task watchdog will run independently.

Building and Running for ST Nucleo L073RZ
=========================================
The sample can be built and executed for the
:ref:`nucleo_l073rz_board` as follows:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/subsys/task_wdt
   :board: nucleo_l073rz
   :goals: build flash
   :compact:

For other boards just replace the board name.

Sample output
=============

The following output is printed and continuously repeated (after each
reset):

.. code-block:: console

   Task watchdog sample application.
   Main thread still alive...
   Control thread started.
   Main thread still alive...
   Main thread still alive...
