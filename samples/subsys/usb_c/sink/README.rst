   Implement a USB-C Power Delivery application in the form of a USB-C Sink.

Overview
********

This example demonstrates how to create a USB-C Power Delivery application and
how to generate USB VIF policies in XML format using the USB-C subsystem. The
application implements a USB-C Sink device.

After the USB-C Sink device is plugged into a Power Delivery charger, it
negotiates with the charger to provide 5V@100mA and displays all
Power Delivery Objects (PDOs) provided by the charger.

Requirements
************
The TCPC device used by the sample is specified in the devicetree
node that's compatible with ``usb-c-connector``.
The sample has been tested on :ref:`b_g474e_dpow1_board` and
:ref:`stm32g081b_eval_board`. Overlay files for the two boards
are provided.

Building and Running
********************

Build and flash as follows, changing ``b_g474e_dpow1`` for your board:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/subsys/usb_c/sink
   :board: b_g474e_dpow1
   :goals: build flash
