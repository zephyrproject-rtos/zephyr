   Implement a USB-C Power Delivery application in the form of a USB-C Source.

Overview
********

This example demonstrates how to create a USB-C Power Delivery application
using the USB-C subsystem. The application implements a USB-C Source device.

After a USB-C Sink device is plugged into the USB-C Source device, it
negotiates with the Source device to provide 5V at 100mA, 9V at 100mA,
or 15V at 100mA and the Requested Data Object (RDO) provided by the Source
is displayed.

Requirements
************
The TCPC device used by the sample is specified in the devicetree
node that's compatible with ``usb-c-connector``.
The sample has been tested on ``stm32g081b_eval``.
An overlay file is provided.

Building and Running
********************

Build and flash as follows, changing ``stm32g081b_eval`` for your board:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/subsys/usb_c/source
   :board: stm32g081b_eval
