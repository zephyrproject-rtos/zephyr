# LLEXT is only required when loading the extension at runtime. Since in this
# basic example there's only one llext, leaving it in when building the
# extension as a built-in is redundant; in a real application, however, there
# could be other uses of the llext subsystem.

# This test consumes large amounts of stack when loading the LLEXT.
# Increase the available size to avoid overflowing (see issue #74536).

# NOTE
#
# This project file explicitly does NOT include the configuration for
# CONFIG_HELLO_WORLD_MODE, so a clean compile will include the function as
# built-in by default.
#
# To build it as an llext, please follow the instructions in the documentation
# of this sample; there are architecture-specific settings that must be set in
# addition to CONFIG_HELLO_WORLD_MODE=m. For example, most ARM targets need to
# either enable CONFIG_USERSPACE (if they support it) or disable MPU/MMU
# features for LLEXT to work correctly.
