   These samples demonstrate the use of USB support in Zephyr RTOS.

Most of the USB support samples can be found under :zephyr_file:`samples/subsys/usb`
in the Zephyr project tree. However, there are a few functions whose samples
are located in different directories. These are:

* Bluetooth HCI USB transport layer implementation is covered by
  :zephyr:code-sample:`bluetooth_hci_usb`
* USB CDC ECM and USB CDC NCM implementations are covered by the networking
  samples :zephyr:code-sample:`zperf` or :zephyr:code-sample:`sockets-http-server`
