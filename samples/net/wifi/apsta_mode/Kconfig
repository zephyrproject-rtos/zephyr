	  Enable this option to start the DHCPv4 server from the application layer,
	  typically before the Soft AP is initialized.

	  When disabled, the DHCPv4 server startup timing is determined by the vendor's
	  implementation. In some cases, the server may be started after the AP is up,
	  using the vendor's default IP address, gateway, subnet mask.

# Some vendors start the DHCPv4 server after Soft AP initialization,
# using default IP address and subnet mask. In such cases, manual
# configuration of gateway and netmask may not be necessary.
# The following options are used only if the DHCPv4 server is started
# by the application.
