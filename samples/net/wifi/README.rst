.. zephyr:code-sample:: wifi-shell
   :name: Wi-Fi shell
   :relevant-api: net_stats

   Test Wi-Fi functionality using the Wi-Fi shell module.

Overview
********

This sample allows testing Wi-Fi drivers for various boards by
enabling the Wi-Fi shell module that provides a set of commands:
scan, connect, and disconnect.  It also enables the net_shell module
to verify net_if settings.

Building and Running
********************

Verify the board and chip you are targeting provide Wi-Fi support.

For instance you can use TI's CC3220 by selecting the cc3220sf_launchxl board.
