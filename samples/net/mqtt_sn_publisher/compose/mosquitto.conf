# General configuration
# =================================================================

# Use per listener security settings.
#
# It is recommended this option be set before any other options.
#
# If this option is set to true, then all authentication and access control
# options are controlled on a per listener basis. The following options are
# affected:
#
# acl_file
# allow_anonymous
# allow_zero_length_clientid
# auto_id_prefix
# password_file
# plugin
# plugin_opt_*
# psk_file
#
# Note that if set to true, then a durable client (i.e. with clean session set
# to false) that has disconnected will use the ACL settings defined for the
# listener that it was most recently connected to.
#
# The default behaviour is for this to be set to false, which maintains the
# setting behaviour from previous versions of mosquitto.
#per_listener_settings false


# This option controls whether a client is allowed to connect with a zero
# length client id or not. This option only affects clients using MQTT v3.1.1
# and later. If set to false, clients connecting with a zero length client id
# are disconnected. If set to true, clients will be allocated a client id by
# the broker. This means it is only useful for clients with clean session set
# to true.
#allow_zero_length_clientid true

# If allow_zero_length_clientid is true, this option allows you to set a prefix
# to automatically generated client ids to aid visibility in logs.
# Defaults to 'auto-'
#auto_id_prefix auto-

# This option affects the scenario when a client subscribes to a topic that has
# retained messages. It is possible that the client that published the retained
# message to the topic had access at the time they published, but that access
# has been subsequently removed. If check_retain_source is set to true, the
# default, the source of a retained message will be checked for access rights
# before it is republished. When set to false, no check will be made and the
# retained message will always be published. This affects all listeners.
#check_retain_source true

# QoS 1 and 2 messages will be allowed inflight per client until this limit
# is exceeded.  Defaults to 0. (No maximum)
# See also max_inflight_messages
#max_inflight_bytes 0

# The maximum number of QoS 1 and 2 messages currently inflight per
# client.
# This includes messages that are partway through handshakes and
# those that are being retried. Defaults to 20. Set to 0 for no
# maximum. Setting to 1 will guarantee in-order delivery of QoS 1
# and 2 messages.
#max_inflight_messages 20

# For MQTT v5 clients, it is possible to have the server send a "server
# keepalive" value that will override the keepalive value set by the client.
# This is intended to be used as a mechanism to say that the server will
# disconnect the client earlier than it anticipated, and that the client should
# use the new keepalive value. The max_keepalive option allows you to specify
# that clients may only connect with keepalive less than or equal to this
# value, otherwise they will be sent a server keepalive telling them to use
# max_keepalive. This only applies to MQTT v5 clients. The default, and maximum
# value allowable, is 65535.
#
# Set to 0 to allow clients to set keepalive = 0, which means no keepalive
# checks are made and the client will never be disconnected by the broker if no
# messages are received. You should be very sure this is the behaviour that you
# want.
#
# For MQTT v3.1.1 and v3.1 clients, there is no mechanism to tell the client
# what keepalive value they should use. If an MQTT v3.1.1 or v3.1 client
# specifies a keepalive time greater than max_keepalive they will be sent a
# CONNACK message with the "identifier rejected" reason code, and disconnected.
#
#max_keepalive 65535

# For MQTT v5 clients, it is possible to have the server send a "maximum packet
# size" value that will instruct the client it will not accept MQTT packets
# with size greater than max_packet_size bytes. This applies to the full MQTT
# packet, not just the payload. Setting this option to a positive value will
# set the maximum packet size to that number of bytes. If a client sends a
# packet which is larger than this value, it will be disconnected. This applies
# to all clients regardless of the protocol version they are using, but v3.1.1
# and earlier clients will of course not have received the maximum packet size
# information. Defaults to no limit. Setting below 20 bytes is forbidden
# because it is likely to interfere with ordinary client operation, even with
# very small payloads.
#max_packet_size 0

# QoS 1 and 2 messages above those currently in-flight will be queued per
# client until this limit is exceeded.  Defaults to 0. (No maximum)
# See also max_queued_messages.
# If both max_queued_messages and max_queued_bytes are specified, packets will
# be queued until the first limit is reached.
#max_queued_bytes 0

# Set the maximum QoS supported. Clients publishing at a QoS higher than
# specified here will be disconnected.
#max_qos 2

# The maximum number of QoS 1 and 2 messages to hold in a queue per client
# above those that are currently in-flight.  Defaults to 1000. Set
# to 0 for no maximum (not recommended).
# See also queue_qos0_messages.
# See also max_queued_bytes.
#max_queued_messages 1000
#
# This option sets the maximum number of heap memory bytes that the broker will
# allocate, and hence sets a hard limit on memory use by the broker.  Memory
# requests that exceed this value will be denied. The effect will vary
# depending on what has been denied. If an incoming message is being processed,
# then the message will be dropped and the publishing client will be
# disconnected. If an outgoing message is being sent, then the individual
# message will be dropped and the receiving client will be disconnected.
# Defaults to no limit.
#memory_limit 0

# This option sets the maximum publish payload size that the broker will allow.
# Received messages that exceed this size will not be accepted by the broker.
# The default value is 0, which means that all valid MQTT messages are
# accepted. MQTT imposes a maximum payload size of 268435455 bytes.
#message_size_limit 0

# This option allows the session of persistent clients (those with clean
# session set to false) that are not currently connected to be removed if they
# do not reconnect within a certain time frame. This is a non-standard option
# in MQTT v3.1. MQTT v3.1.1 and v5.0 allow brokers to remove client sessions.
#
# Badly designed clients may set clean session to false whilst using a randomly
# generated client id. This leads to persistent clients that connect once and
# never reconnect. This option allows these clients to be removed.  This option
# allows persistent clients (those with clean session set to false) to be
# removed if they do not reconnect within a certain time frame.
#
# The expiration period should be an integer followed by one of h d w m y for
# hour, day, week, month and year respectively. For example
#
# persistent_client_expiration 2m
# persistent_client_expiration 14d
# persistent_client_expiration 1y
#
# The default if not set is to never expire persistent clients.
#persistent_client_expiration

# Write process id to a file. Default is a blank string which means
# a pid file shouldn't be written.
# This should be set to /var/run/mosquitto/mosquitto.pid if mosquitto is
# being run automatically on boot with an init script and
# start-stop-daemon or similar.
#pid_file

# Set to true to queue messages with QoS 0 when a persistent client is
# disconnected. These messages are included in the limit imposed by
# max_queued_messages and max_queued_bytes
# Defaults to false.
# This is a non-standard option for the MQTT v3.1 spec but is allowed in
# v3.1.1.
#queue_qos0_messages false

# Set to false to disable retained message support. If a client publishes a
# message with the retain bit set, it will be disconnected if this is set to
# false.
#retain_available true

# Disable Nagle's algorithm on client sockets. This has the effect of reducing
# latency of individual messages at the potential cost of increasing the number
# of packets being sent.
#set_tcp_nodelay false

# Time in seconds between updates of the $SYS tree.
# Set to 0 to disable the publishing of the $SYS tree.
#sys_interval 10

# The MQTT specification requires that the QoS of a message delivered to a
# subscriber is never upgraded to match the QoS of the subscription. Enabling
# this option changes this behaviour. If upgrade_outgoing_qos is set true,
# messages sent to a subscriber will always match the QoS of its subscription.
# This is a non-standard option explicitly disallowed by the spec.
#upgrade_outgoing_qos false

# When run as root, drop privileges to this user and its primary
# group.
# Set to root to stay as root, but this is not recommended.
# If set to "mosquitto", or left unset, and the "mosquitto" user does not exist
# then it will drop privileges to the "nobody" user instead.
# If run as a non-root user, this setting has no effect.
# Note that on Windows this has no effect and so mosquitto should be started by
# the user you wish it to run as.
#user mosquitto

# =================================================================
# Listeners
# =================================================================

# Listen on a port/ip address combination. By using this variable
# multiple times, mosquitto can listen on more than one port. If
# this variable is used and neither bind_address nor port given,
# then the default listener will not be started.
# The port number to listen on must be given. Optionally, an ip
# address or host name may be supplied as a second argument. In
# this case, mosquitto will attempt to bind the listener to that
# address and so restrict access to the associated network and
# interface. By default, mosquitto will listen on all interfaces.
# Note that for a websockets listener it is not possible to bind to a host
# name.
#
# On systems that support Unix Domain Sockets, it is also possible
# to create a # Unix socket rather than opening a TCP socket. In
# this case, the port number should be set to 0 and a unix socket
# path must be provided, e.g.
# listener 0 /tmp/mosquitto.sock
#
# listener port-number [ip address/host name/unix socket path]
listener 1883

# By default, a listener will attempt to listen on all supported IP protocol
# versions. If you do not have an IPv4 or IPv6 interface you may wish to
# disable support for either of those protocol versions. In particular, note
# that due to the limitations of the websockets library, it will only ever
# attempt to open IPv6 sockets if IPv6 support is compiled in, and so will fail
# if IPv6 is not available.
#
# Set to `ipv4` to force the listener to only use IPv4, or set to `ipv6` to
# force the listener to only use IPv6. If you want support for both IPv4 and
# IPv6, then do not use the socket_domain option.
#
#socket_domain

# Bind the listener to a specific interface. This is similar to
# the [ip address/host name] part of the listener definition, but is useful
# when an interface has multiple addresses or the address may change. If used
# with the [ip address/host name] part of the listener definition, then the
# bind_interface option will take priority.
# Not available on Windows.
#
# Example: bind_interface eth0
#bind_interface

# When a listener is using the websockets protocol, it is possible to serve
# http data as well. Set http_dir to a directory which contains the files you
# wish to serve. If this option is not specified, then no normal http
# connections will be possible.
#http_dir

# The maximum number of client connections to allow. This is
# a per listener setting.
# Default is -1, which means unlimited connections.
# Note that other process limits mean that unlimited connections
# are not really possible. Typically the default maximum number of
# connections possible is around 1024.
#max_connections -1

# The listener can be restricted to operating within a topic hierarchy using
# the mount_point option. This is achieved be prefixing the mount_point string
# to all topics for any clients connected to this listener. This prefixing only
# happens internally to the broker; the client will not see the prefix.
#mount_point

# Choose the protocol to use when listening.
# This can be either mqtt or websockets.
# Certificate based TLS may be used with websockets, except that only the
# cafile, certfile, keyfile, ciphers, and ciphers_tls13 options are supported.
#protocol mqtt

# Set use_username_as_clientid to true to replace the clientid that a client
# connected with its username. This allows authentication to be tied to
# the clientid, which means that it is possible to prevent one client
# disconnecting another by using the same clientid.
# If a client connects with no username it will be disconnected as not
# authorised when this option is set to true.
# Do not use in conjunction with clientid_prefixes.
# See also use_identity_as_username.
# This does not apply globally, but on a per-listener basis.
#use_username_as_clientid

# Change the websockets headers size. This is a global option, it is not
# possible to set per listener. This option sets the size of the buffer used in
# the libwebsockets library when reading HTTP headers. If you are passing large
# header data such as cookies then you may need to increase this value. If left
# unset, or set to 0, then the default of 1024 bytes will be used.
#websockets_headers_size

# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Certificate based SSL/TLS support
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# The following options can be used to enable certificate based SSL/TLS support
# for this listener. Note that the recommended port for MQTT over TLS is 8883,
# but this must be set manually.
#
# See also the mosquitto-tls man page and the "Pre-shared-key based SSL/TLS
# support" section. Only one of certificate or PSK encryption support can be
# enabled for any listener.

# Both of certfile and keyfile must be defined to enable certificate based
# TLS encryption.

# Path to the PEM encoded server certificate.
#certfile

# Path to the PEM encoded keyfile.
#keyfile

# If you wish to control which encryption ciphers are used, use the ciphers
# option. The list of available ciphers can be optained using the "openssl
# ciphers" command and should be provided in the same format as the output of
# that command. This applies to TLS 1.2 and earlier versions only. Use
# ciphers_tls1.3 for TLS v1.3.
#ciphers

# Choose which TLS v1.3 ciphersuites are used for this listener.
# Defaults to "TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256:TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256"
#ciphers_tls1.3

# If you have require_certificate set to true, you can create a certificate
# revocation list file to revoke access to particular client certificates. If
# you have done this, use crlfile to point to the PEM encoded revocation file.
#crlfile

# To allow the use of ephemeral DH key exchange, which provides forward
# security, the listener must load DH parameters. This can be specified with
# the dhparamfile option. The dhparamfile can be generated with the command
# e.g. "openssl dhparam -out dhparam.pem 2048"
#dhparamfile

# By default an TLS enabled listener will operate in a similar fashion to a
# https enabled web server, in that the server has a certificate signed by a CA
# and the client will verify that it is a trusted certificate. The overall aim
# is encryption of the network traffic. By setting require_certificate to true,
# the client must provide a valid certificate in order for the network
# connection to proceed. This allows access to the broker to be controlled
# outside of the mechanisms provided by MQTT.
#require_certificate false

# cafile and capath define methods of accessing the PEM encoded
# Certificate Authority certificates that will be considered trusted when
# checking incoming client certificates.
# cafile defines the path to a file containing the CA certificates.
# capath defines a directory that will be searched for files
# containing the CA certificates. For capath to work correctly, the
# certificate files must have ".crt" as the file ending and you must run
# "openssl rehash <path to capath>" each time you add/remove a certificate.
#cafile
#capath


# If require_certificate is true, you may set use_identity_as_username to true
# to use the CN value from the client certificate as a username. If this is
# true, the password_file option will not be used for this listener.
#use_identity_as_username false

# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Pre-shared-key based SSL/TLS support
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# The following options can be used to enable PSK based SSL/TLS support for
# this listener. Note that the recommended port for MQTT over TLS is 8883, but
# this must be set manually.
#
# See also the mosquitto-tls man page and the "Certificate based SSL/TLS
# support" section. Only one of certificate or PSK encryption support can be
# enabled for any listener.

# The psk_hint option enables pre-shared-key support for this listener and also
# acts as an identifier for this listener. The hint is sent to clients and may
# be used locally to aid authentication. The hint is a free form string that
# doesn't have much meaning in itself, so feel free to be creative.
# If this option is provided, see psk_file to define the pre-shared keys to be
# used or create a security plugin to handle them.
#psk_hint

# When using PSK, the encryption ciphers used will be chosen from the list of
# available PSK ciphers. If you want to control which ciphers are available,
# use the "ciphers" option.  The list of available ciphers can be optained
# using the "openssl ciphers" command and should be provided in the same format
# as the output of that command.
#ciphers

# Set use_identity_as_username to have the psk identity sent by the client used
# as its username. Authentication will be carried out using the PSK rather than
# the MQTT username/password and so password_file will not be used for this
# listener.
#use_identity_as_username false


# =================================================================
# Persistence
# =================================================================

# If persistence is enabled, save the in-memory database to disk
# every autosave_interval seconds. If set to 0, the persistence
# database will only be written when mosquitto exits. See also
# autosave_on_changes.
# Note that writing of the persistence database can be forced by
# sending mosquitto a SIGUSR1 signal.
#autosave_interval 1800

# If true, mosquitto will count the number of subscription changes, retained
# messages received and queued messages and if the total exceeds
# autosave_interval then the in-memory database will be saved to disk.
# If false, mosquitto will save the in-memory database to disk by treating
# autosave_interval as a time in seconds.
#autosave_on_changes false

# Save persistent message data to disk (true/false).
# This saves information about all messages, including
# subscriptions, currently in-flight messages and retained
# messages.
# retained_persistence is a synonym for this option.
#persistence false

# The filename to use for the persistent database, not including
# the path.
#persistence_file mosquitto.db

# Location for persistent database.
# Default is an empty string (current directory).
# Set to e.g. /var/lib/mosquitto if running as a proper service on Linux or
# similar.
#persistence_location


# =================================================================
# Logging
# =================================================================

# Places to log to. Use multiple log_dest lines for multiple
# logging destinations.
# Possible destinations are: stdout stderr syslog topic file dlt
#
# stdout and stderr log to the console on the named output.
#
# syslog uses the userspace syslog facility which usually ends up
# in /var/log/messages or similar.
#
# topic logs to the broker topic '$SYS/broker/log/<severity>',
# where severity is one of D, E, W, N, I, M which are debug, error,
# warning, notice, information and message. Message type severity is used by
# the subscribe/unsubscribe log_types and publishes log messages to
# $SYS/broker/log/M/susbcribe or $SYS/broker/log/M/unsubscribe.
#
# The file destination requires an additional parameter which is the file to be
# logged to, e.g. "log_dest file /var/log/mosquitto.log". The file will be
# closed and reopened when the broker receives a HUP signal. Only a single file
# destination may be configured.
#
# The dlt destination is for the automotive `Diagnostic Log and Trace` tool.
# This requires that Mosquitto has been compiled with DLT support.
#
# Note that if the broker is running as a Windows service it will default to
# "log_dest none" and neither stdout nor stderr logging is available.
# Use "log_dest none" if you wish to disable logging.
#log_dest stderr

# Types of messages to log. Use multiple log_type lines for logging
# multiple types of messages.
# Possible types are: debug, error, warning, notice, information,
# none, subscribe, unsubscribe, websockets, all.
# Note that debug type messages are for decoding the incoming/outgoing
# network packets. They are not logged in "topics".
#log_type error
#log_type warning
#log_type notice
#log_type information


# If set to true, client connection and disconnection messages will be included
# in the log.
#connection_messages true

# If using syslog logging (not on Windows), messages will be logged to the
# "daemon" facility by default. Use the log_facility option to choose which of
# local0 to local7 to log to instead. The option value should be an integer
# value, e.g. "log_facility 5" to use local5.
#log_facility

# If set to true, add a timestamp value to each log message.
#log_timestamp true

# Set the format of the log timestamp. If left unset, this is the number of
# seconds since the Unix epoch.
# This is a free text string which will be passed to the strftime function. To
# get an ISO 8601 datetime, for example:
# log_timestamp_format %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S
#log_timestamp_format

# Change the websockets logging level. This is a global option, it is not
# possible to set per listener. This is an integer that is interpreted by
# libwebsockets as a bit mask for its lws_log_levels enum. See the
# libwebsockets documentation for more details. "log_type websockets" must also
# be enabled.
#websockets_log_level 0


# =================================================================
# Security
# =================================================================

# If set, only clients that have a matching prefix on their
# clientid will be allowed to connect to the broker. By default,
# all clients may connect.
# For example, setting "secure-" here would mean a client "secure-
# client" could connect but another with clientid "mqtt" couldn't.
#clientid_prefixes

# Boolean value that determines whether clients that connect
# without providing a username are allowed to connect. If set to
# false then a password file should be created (see the
# password_file option) to control authenticated client access.
#
# Defaults to false, unless there are no listeners defined in the configuration
# file, in which case it is set to true, but connections are only allowed from
# the local machine.
allow_anonymous true

# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Default authentication and topic access control
# -----------------------------------------------------------------

# Control access to the broker using a password file. This file can be
# generated using the mosquitto_passwd utility. If TLS support is not compiled
# into mosquitto (it is recommended that TLS support should be included) then
# plain text passwords are used, in which case the file should be a text file
# with lines in the format:
# username:password
# The password (and colon) may be omitted if desired, although this
# offers very little in the way of security.
#
# See the TLS client require_certificate and use_identity_as_username options
# for alternative authentication options. If a plugin is used as well as
# password_file, the plugin check will be made first.
#password_file

# Access may also be controlled using a pre-shared-key file. This requires
# TLS-PSK support and a listener configured to use it. The file should be text
# lines in the format:
# identity:key
# The key should be in hexadecimal format without a leading "0x".
# If an plugin is used as well, the plugin check will be made first.
#psk_file

# Control access to topics on the broker using an access control list
# file. If this parameter is defined then only the topics listed will
# have access.
# If the first character of a line of the ACL file is a # it is treated as a
# comment.
# Topic access is added with lines of the format:
#
# topic [read|write|readwrite|deny] <topic>
#
# The access type is controlled using "read", "write", "readwrite" or "deny".
# This parameter is optional (unless <topic> contains a space character) - if
# not given then the access is read/write.  <topic> can contain the + or #
# wildcards as in subscriptions.
#
# The "deny" option can used to explicitly deny access to a topic that would
# otherwise be granted by a broader read/write/readwrite statement. Any "deny"
# topics are handled before topics that grant read/write access.
#
# The first set of topics are applied to anonymous clients, assuming
# allow_anonymous is true. User specific topic ACLs are added after a
# user line as follows:
#
# user <username>
#
# The username referred to here is the same as in password_file. It is
# not the clientid.
#
#
# If is also possible to define ACLs based on pattern substitution within the
# topic. The patterns available for substition are:
#
# %c to match the client id of the client
# %u to match the username of the client
#
# The substitution pattern must be the only text for that level of hierarchy.
#
# The form is the same as for the topic keyword, but using pattern as the
# keyword.
# Pattern ACLs apply to all users even if the "user" keyword has previously
# been given.
#
# If using bridges with usernames and ACLs, connection messages can be allowed
# with the following pattern:
# pattern write $SYS/broker/connection/%c/state
#
# pattern [read|write|readwrite] <topic>
#
# Example:
#
# pattern write sensor/%u/data
#
# If an plugin is used as well as acl_file, the plugin check will be
# made first.
#acl_file

# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# External authentication and topic access plugin options
# -----------------------------------------------------------------

# External authentication and access control can be supported with the
# plugin option. This is a path to a loadable plugin. See also the
# plugin_opt_* options described below.
#
# The plugin option can be specified multiple times to load multiple
# plugins. The plugins will be processed in the order that they are specified
# here. If the plugin option is specified alongside either of
# password_file or acl_file then the plugin checks will be made first.
#
# If the per_listener_settings option is false, the plugin will be apply to all
# listeners. If per_listener_settings is true, then the plugin will apply to
# the current listener being defined only.
#
# This option is also available as `auth_plugin`, but this use is deprecated
# and will be removed in the future.
#
#plugin

# If the plugin option above is used, define options to pass to the
# plugin here as described by the plugin instructions. All options named
# using the format plugin_opt_* will be passed to the plugin, for example:
#
# This option is also available as `auth_opt_*`, but this use is deprecated
# and will be removed in the future.
#
# plugin_opt_db_host
# plugin_opt_db_port
# plugin_opt_db_username
# plugin_opt_db_password


# =================================================================
# Bridges
# =================================================================

# A bridge is a way of connecting multiple MQTT brokers together.
# Create a new bridge using the "connection" option as described below. Set
# options for the bridges using the remaining parameters. You must specify the
# address and at least one topic to subscribe to.
#
# Each connection must have a unique name.
#
# The address line may have multiple host address and ports specified. See
# below in the round_robin description for more details on bridge behaviour if
# multiple addresses are used. Note that if you use an IPv6 address, then you
# are required to specify a port.
#
# The direction that the topic will be shared can be chosen by
# specifying out, in or both, where the default value is out.
# The QoS level of the bridged communication can be specified with the next
# topic option. The default QoS level is 0, to change the QoS the topic
# direction must also be given.
#
# The local and remote prefix options allow a topic to be remapped when it is
# bridged to/from the remote broker. This provides the ability to place a topic
# tree in an appropriate location.
#
# For more details see the mosquitto.conf man page.
#
# Multiple topics can be specified per connection, but be careful
# not to create any loops.
#
# If you are using bridges with cleansession set to false (the default), then
# you may get unexpected behaviour from incoming topics if you change what
# topics you are subscribing to. This is because the remote broker keeps the
# subscription for the old topic. If you have this problem, connect your bridge
# with cleansession set to true, then reconnect with cleansession set to false
# as normal.
#connection <name>
#address <host>[:<port>] [<host>[:<port>]]
#topic <topic> [[[out | in | both] qos-level] local-prefix remote-prefix]

# If you need to have the bridge connect over a particular network interface,
# use bridge_bind_address to tell the bridge which local IP address the socket
# should bind to, e.g. `bridge_bind_address 192.168.1.10`
#bridge_bind_address

# If a bridge has topics that have "out" direction, the default behaviour is to
# send an unsubscribe request to the remote broker on that topic. This means
# that changing a topic direction from "in" to "out" will not keep receiving
# incoming messages. Sending these unsubscribe requests is not always
# desirable, setting bridge_attempt_unsubscribe to false will disable sending
# the unsubscribe request.
#bridge_attempt_unsubscribe true

# Set the version of the MQTT protocol to use with for this bridge. Can be one
# of mqttv50, mqttv311 or mqttv31. Defaults to mqttv311.
#bridge_protocol_version mqttv311

# Set the clean session variable for this bridge.
# When set to true, when the bridge disconnects for any reason, all
# messages and subscriptions will be cleaned up on the remote
# broker. Note that with cleansession set to true, there may be a
# significant amount of retained messages sent when the bridge
# reconnects after losing its connection.
# When set to false, the subscriptions and messages are kept on the
# remote broker, and delivered when the bridge reconnects.
#cleansession false

# Set the amount of time a bridge using the lazy start type must be idle before
# it will be stopped. Defaults to 60 seconds.
#idle_timeout 60

# Set the keepalive interval for this bridge connection, in
# seconds.
#keepalive_interval 60

# Set the clientid to use on the local broker. If not defined, this defaults to
# 'local.<clientid>'. If you are bridging a broker to itself, it is important
# that local_clientid and clientid do not match.
#local_clientid

# If set to true, publish notification messages to the local and remote brokers
# giving information about the state of the bridge connection. Retained
# messages are published to the topic $SYS/broker/connection/<clientid>/state
# unless the notification_topic option is used.
# If the message is 1 then the connection is active, or 0 if the connection has
# failed.
# This uses the last will and testament feature.
#notifications true

# Choose the topic on which notification messages for this bridge are
# published. If not set, messages are published on the topic
# $SYS/broker/connection/<clientid>/state
#notification_topic

# Set the client id to use on the remote end of this bridge connection. If not
# defined, this defaults to 'name.hostname' where name is the connection name
# and hostname is the hostname of this computer.
# This replaces the old "clientid" option to avoid confusion. "clientid"
# remains valid for the time being.
#remote_clientid

# Set the password to use when connecting to a broker that requires
# authentication. This option is only used if remote_username is also set.
# This replaces the old "password" option to avoid confusion. "password"
# remains valid for the time being.
#remote_password

# Set the username to use when connecting to a broker that requires
# authentication.
# This replaces the old "username" option to avoid confusion. "username"
# remains valid for the time being.
#remote_username

# Set the amount of time a bridge using the automatic start type will wait
# until attempting to reconnect.
# This option can be configured to use a constant delay time in seconds, or to
# use a backoff mechanism based on "Decorrelated Jitter", which adds a degree
# of randomness to when the restart occurs.
#
# Set a constant timeout of 20 seconds:
# restart_timeout 20
#
# Set backoff with a base (start value) of 10 seconds and a cap (upper limit) of
# 60 seconds:
# restart_timeout 10 30
#
# Defaults to jitter with a base of 5 and cap of 30
#restart_timeout 5 30

# If the bridge has more than one address given in the address/addresses
# configuration, the round_robin option defines the behaviour of the bridge on
# a failure of the bridge connection. If round_robin is false, the default
# value, then the first address is treated as the main bridge connection. If
# the connection fails, the other secondary addresses will be attempted in
# turn. Whilst connected to a secondary bridge, the bridge will periodically
# attempt to reconnect to the main bridge until successful.
# If round_robin is true, then all addresses are treated as equals. If a
# connection fails, the next address will be tried and if successful will
# remain connected until it fails
#round_robin false

# Set the start type of the bridge. This controls how the bridge starts and
# can be one of three types: automatic, lazy and once. Note that RSMB provides
# a fourth start type "manual" which isn't currently supported by mosquitto.
#
# "automatic" is the default start type and means that the bridge connection
# will be started automatically when the broker starts and also restarted
# after a short delay (30 seconds) if the connection fails.
#
# Bridges using the "lazy" start type will be started automatically when the
# number of queued messages exceeds the number set with the "threshold"
# parameter. It will be stopped automatically after the time set by the
# "idle_timeout" parameter. Use this start type if you wish the connection to
# only be active when it is needed.
#
# A bridge using the "once" start type will be started automatically when the
# broker starts but will not be restarted if the connection fails.
#start_type automatic

# Set the number of messages that need to be queued for a bridge with lazy
# start type to be restarted. Defaults to 10 messages.
# Must be less than max_queued_messages.
#threshold 10

# If try_private is set to true, the bridge will attempt to indicate to the
# remote broker that it is a bridge not an ordinary client. If successful, this
# means that loop detection will be more effective and that retained messages
# will be propagated correctly. Not all brokers support this feature so it may
# be necessary to set try_private to false if your bridge does not connect
# properly.
#try_private true

# Some MQTT brokers do not allow retained messages. MQTT v5 gives a mechanism
# for brokers to tell clients that they do not support retained messages, but
# this is not possible for MQTT v3.1.1 or v3.1. If you need to bridge to a
# v3.1.1 or v3.1 broker that does not support retained messages, set the
# bridge_outgoing_retain option to false. This will remove the retain bit on
# all outgoing messages to that bridge, regardless of any other setting.
#bridge_outgoing_retain true

# If you wish to restrict the size of messages sent to a remote bridge, use the
# bridge_max_packet_size option. This sets the maximum number of bytes for
# the total message, including headers and payload.
# Note that MQTT v5 brokers may provide their own maximum-packet-size property.
# In this case, the smaller of the two limits will be used.
# Set to 0 for "unlimited".
#bridge_max_packet_size 0


# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Certificate based SSL/TLS support
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Either bridge_cafile or bridge_capath must be defined to enable TLS support
# for this bridge.
# bridge_cafile defines the path to a file containing the
# Certificate Authority certificates that have signed the remote broker
# certificate.
# bridge_capath defines a directory that will be searched for files containing
# the CA certificates. For bridge_capath to work correctly, the certificate
# files must have ".crt" as the file ending and you must run "openssl rehash
# <path to capath>" each time you add/remove a certificate.
#bridge_cafile
#bridge_capath


# If the remote broker has more than one protocol available on its port, e.g.
# MQTT and WebSockets, then use bridge_alpn to configure which protocol is
# requested. Note that WebSockets support for bridges is not yet available.
#bridge_alpn

# When using certificate based encryption, bridge_insecure disables
# verification of the server hostname in the server certificate. This can be
# useful when testing initial server configurations, but makes it possible for
# a malicious third party to impersonate your server through DNS spoofing, for
# example. Use this option in testing only. If you need to resort to using this
# option in a production environment, your setup is at fault and there is no
# point using encryption.
#bridge_insecure false

# Path to the PEM encoded client certificate, if required by the remote broker.
#bridge_certfile

# Path to the PEM encoded client private key, if required by the remote broker.
#bridge_keyfile

# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# PSK based SSL/TLS support
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Pre-shared-key encryption provides an alternative to certificate based
# encryption. A bridge can be configured to use PSK with the bridge_identity
# and bridge_psk options. These are the client PSK identity, and pre-shared-key
# in hexadecimal format with no "0x". Only one of certificate and PSK based
# encryption can be used on one
# bridge at once.
#bridge_identity
#bridge_psk


# =================================================================
# External config files
# =================================================================

# External configuration files may be included by using the
# include_dir option. This defines a directory that will be searched
# for config files. All files that end in '.conf' will be loaded as
# a configuration file. It is best to have this as the last option
# in the main file. This option will only be processed from the main
# configuration file. The directory specified must not contain the
# main configuration file.
# Files within include_dir will be loaded sorted in case-sensitive
# alphabetical order, with capital letters ordered first. If this option is
# given multiple times, all of the files from the first instance will be
# processed before the next instance. See the man page for examples.
