.. zephyr:code-sample:: sntp-server
   :name: SNTP server
   :relevant-api: bsd_sockets sntp

   SNTP to get the current time from the host.

Overview
********

This sample is a simple SNTP server implementation.
The demo will query a SNTP server and set the system time and date.
When the local clock is set, the system will respond to SNTP queries
on port 123, the default SNTP port.
You can query the server using a SNTP client, such as ntpdig or sntp.

This demo assumes that the platform of choice has networking support,
some adjustments to the configuration may be needed.
