.. zephyr:code-sample:: coap-client
   :name: CoAP client
   :relevant-api: coap udp

   Use the CoAP library to implement a client that fetches a resource.

Overview
********

This sample is a simple CoAP client showing how to retrieve information
from a resource.

This demo assumes that the platform of choice has networking support,
some adjustments to the configuration may be needed.

This sample will make a GET request with path 'test' to the IPv6
multicast address reserved for CoAP nodes, so the URI can be
represented as:

.. code-block:: none

    coap://[ff02::fd]:5683/test

Building and Running
********************

This project will print all the octets of the response received, more context can
be obtained by using a tool such as tcpdump or wireshark.

See the `net-tools`_ project for more details.

This sample can be built and executed on QEMU or native_sim board as described
in :ref:`networking_with_host`.
