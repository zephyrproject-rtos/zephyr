config NET_SAMPLE_PEER
	string "Peer IP address we are sending packets to"
	help
	  The value depends on your network setup. This could be
	  a multicast address if needed. If port is not specified,
	  then 4242 is used. Currently the port value is only used
	  when selecting UDP socket type.
	  Syntax of the IP address string:
	     192.0.2.1:80
	     192.0.2.42
	     [2001:db8::1]:8080
	     [2001:db8::2]
	     2001:db::42

choice
	prompt "Socket type to use"
	help
	  Can be used to select whether the application will use UDP
	  socket to send data, or if it uses AF_PACKET (raw) socket.

config NET_SAMPLE_UDP_SOCKET
	bool "UDP socket"
	help
	  Use UDP socket.

config NET_SAMPLE_PACKET_SOCKET
	bool "Packet socket"
	select NET_SOCKETS_PACKET
	help
	  Use AF_PACKET socket. Note that currently the application sends
	  dummy data that is not a valid Ethernet frame. We want to measure
	  how long it takes to send data so the actual data content is not
	  important for this sample application.

config NET_SAMPLE_PACKET_INTERVAL
	int "How long to wait between sent packets (in milliseconds)"
	default 1000
	range 1 10000
	help
	  The application will send network packets between this
	  interval. The value is in milliseconds.

config NET_SAMPLE_PACKET_TXTIME
	int "What is the TXTIME (in microseconds)"
	default 1000
	range 1 10000
	help
	  This tells what is the expected sending time of the network
	  packet by the network device driver. The value is in microseconds.
	  This value should be smaller than the interval time
	  (NET_SAMPLE_PACKET_INTERVAL). This value is added to current
	  time from PTP clock, to set the expected transmit time. Note that
	  the actual TXTIME given to Ethernet driver, is set in nanoseconds,
	  but for purpose of this sample application, we set the time in
	  microseconds in this config option.
