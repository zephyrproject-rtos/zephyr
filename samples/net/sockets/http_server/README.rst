.. zephyr:code-sample:: sockets-http-server
   :name: HTTP Server
   :relevant-api: http_service http_server tls_credentials

   Implement an HTTP(s) Server demonstrating various resource types.

Overview
--------

This sample application demonstrates the use of the :ref:`http_server_interface` library.
This library provides high-level functions to simplify and abstract server implementation.
The server supports the HTTP/1.1 protocol which can also be upgraded to HTTP/2,
it also support native HTTP/2 protocol without upgrading.

Requirement
-----------

`QEMU Networking <https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/connectivity/networking/qemu_setup.html#networking-with-qemu>`_

Building and running the server
-------------------------------

There are configuration files for various setups in the
:zephyr_file:`samples/net/sockets/http_server` directory:

.. list-table::

    * - :zephyr_file:`prj.conf <samples/net/sockets/http_server/prj.conf>`
      - This is the standard default config.

    * - :zephyr_file:`ieee802154-overlay.conf <samples/net/sockets/http_server/ieee802154-overlay.conf>`
      - This overlay config can be added for IEEE 802.15.4 support.

    * - :zephyr_file:`overlay-netusb.conf <samples/net/sockets/http_server/overlay-netusb.conf>`
      - This overlay config can be added for connecting via network USB.

    * - :zephyr_file:`overlay-tls.conf <samples/net/sockets/http_server/overlay-tls.conf>`
      - This overlay config can be added to build the HTTPS variant.

To build and run the HTTP server application:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ west build -p auto -b <board_to_use> -t run samples/net/sockets/http_server

For the HTTPS version:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ west build -p auto -b <board_to_use> -t run --test samples/net/sockets/http_server/sample.net.sockets.https.server

When the server is up, we can make requests to the server using either HTTP/1.1 or
HTTP/2 protocol from the host machine.

**With HTTP/1.1:**

- Using a browser: ``http://192.0.2.1/``
- Using curl: ``curl -v --compressed http://192.0.2.1/``
- Using ab (Apache Bench): ``ab -n10 http://192.0.2.1/``

**With HTTP/2:**

- Using nghttp client: ``nghttp -v --no-dep http://192.0.2.1/``
- Using curl: ``curl --http2 -v --compressed http://192.0.2.1/``
- Using h2load: ``h2load -n10 http://192.0.2.1/``

Web browsers use stricter security settings for the HTTP/2 protocol. So to use HTTP/2
with a web browser, you must ALPN (add ``-DCONFIG_NET_SAMPLE_HTTPS_USE_ALPN`` to
the west build command) on top of the HTTPS build shown above.
Additionally the server certificate must be signed by a CA certificate trusted
by your browser.

The best way to do this is to generate your own CA certificate:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ west build -b <board_to_use> -t sample_ca_cert samples/net/sockets/http_server

Generate a server certificate signed by this CA certificate:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ west build -t sample_server_cert samples/net/sockets/http_server

And then build the application with the newly generated server certificate and key:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ west build samples/net/sockets/http_server

The CA certificate should be added to your browser's list of trusted authorities to
enable usage of HTTP/2. If using Firefox, it may also be required to change the setting
``network.http.http2.enforce-tls-profile`` to false, since it seems that using a CA
certificate issued by an authority unknown to Firefox is considered a security error when
using HTTP/2.

Server Customization
---------------------

The server sample contains several parameters that can be customized based on
the requirements. These are the configurable parameters:

- ``CONFIG_NET_SAMPLE_HTTP_SERVER_SERVICE_PORT``: Configures the service port.

- ``CONFIG_HTTP_SERVER_MAX_CLIENTS``: Defines the maximum number of HTTP/2
  clients that the server can handle simultaneously.

- ``CONFIG_HTTP_SERVER_MAX_STREAMS``: Specifies the maximum number of HTTP/2
  streams that can be established per client.

- ``CONFIG_HTTP_SERVER_CLIENT_BUFFER_SIZE``: Defines the buffer size allocated
  for each client. This limits the maximum length of an individual HTTP header
  supported.

- ``CONFIG_HTTP_SERVER_MAX_URL_LENGTH``: Specifies the maximum length of an HTTP
  URL that the server can process.

- ``CONFIG_NET_SAMPLE_WEBSOCKET_SERVICE``: Enables Websocket service endpoint.
  This allows a Websocket client to connect to ``/`` endpoint, all the data that
  the client sends is echoed back.

To customize these options, we can run ``west build -t menuconfig``, which provides
us with an interactive configuration interface. Then we could navigate from the top-level
menu to: ``-> Subsystems and OS Services -> Networking -> Network Protocols``.

Websocket Connectivity
----------------------

You can use a simple Websocket client application like this to test the Websocket
connectivity.

.. code-block:: python

   import websocket

   websocket.enableTrace(True)
   ws = websocket.WebSocket()
   ws.connect("ws://192.0.2.1/ws_echo")
   ws.send("Hello, Server")
   print(ws.recv())
   while True:
     line = input("> ")
     if line == "quit":
       break
     ws.send(line)
     print(ws.recv())
   ws.close()


Testing over USB
----------------

Let's see a real example on how the HTTP(S) server can be tested on a real device
using an USB connection toward a Linux host PC. For this purpose let's take an
NRF52840 board as example.

First of all build the sample enabling HTTPS service and flash the board:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
         :zephyr-app: samples/net/sockets/http_server/
         :board: nrf52840dk/nrf52840
         :goals: build
         :gen-args: -DCONFIG_NET_SAMPLE_HTTPS_SERVICE=y -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE=overlay-netusb.conf

Then connect the USB cable to the host PC and issue:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ip link show

to get the device name Linux assigned to the USB-Ethernet interface. For the
following let's assume that the name is ``eth-device``.

Now we need to configure IP and routing for this interface:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo ip addr add 192.0.2.2/24 dev eth-device
   $ sudo ip route add 192.0.2.0/24 dev eth-device

Here:

* we picked an IP address for the interface, i.e. ``192.0.2.2/24``, which is
  different form the server one, i.e. :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NET_CONFIG_MY_IPV4_ADDR`,
  but in the allowed IP range defined by the ``/24`` mask.
* we assume that 192.168.0.x range do not conflict with other addresses and
  routes in the host system. If that's the case, then all IP addresses should
  be fixed (sample, host IP interface, certificate).

Once this is done, it should be possible to test either HTTP and HTTPS with
``curl``:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ curl -v --compressed http://192.0.2.1
   $ curl -v --compressed https://192.0.2.1

.. note::

   To have a successful HTTPS connection ensure to update the CA certificates
   of the host Linux system adding
   :zephyr_file:`samples/net/sockets/http_server/src/certs/ca_cert.pem` to the
   list of known CAs.

Performance Analysis
--------------------

CPU Usage Profiling
*******************

We can use ``perf`` to collect statistics about the CPU usage of our server
running in native_sim board with the ``stat`` command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo perf stat -p <pid_of_server>

``perf stat`` will then start monitoring our server. We can let it run while
sending requests to our server. Once we've collected enough data, we can
stop ``perf stat``, which will print a summary of the performance statistics.

Hotspot Analysis
****************

``perf record`` and ``perf report`` can be used together to identify the
functions in our code that consume the most CPU time:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo perf record -g -p <pid_of_server> -o perf.data

After running our server under load (For example, using ApacheBench tool),
we can stop the recording and analyze the data using:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo perf report -i perf.data

After generating a file named ``perf.data`` which contains the profiling data,
we can visualize it using ``FlameGraph`` tool. It's particularly useful for
identifying the most expensive code-paths and inspect where our application is
spending the most time.

To do this, we need to convert the ``perf.data`` to a format that ``FlameGraph``
can understand:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo perf script | ~/FlameGraph/stackcollapse-perf.pl > out.perf-folded

And, then, generate the ``FlameGraph``:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ~/FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl out.perf-folded > flamegraph.svg

We can view flamegraph.svg using a web browser.
