   :name: Network statistics
   :relevant-api: net_stats

   Query and display network statistics from a user application.

Overview
********

This sample shows how to query (and display) network statistics from a user
application.

The source code for this sample application can be found at:
:zephyr_file:`samples/net/stats`.

Requirements
************

- :ref:`networking_with_host`

Building and Running
********************

A good way to run this sample application is with QEMU or native_sim board
as described in :ref:`networking_with_host`.

Follow these steps to build the network statistics sample application:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/net/stats
   :board: <board to use>
   :conf: prj.conf
   :goals: build
   :compact:

If everything is configured correctly, the application will periodically print
current network statistics to the console.

.. code-block:: console
