   Perform IPv4 autoconfiguration and self-assign a random IPv4 address

Overview
********

This sample application starts a IPv4 autoconf and self-assigns
a random IPv4 address in the 169.254.0.0/16 range, it defends
the IPv4 address and resolves IPv4 conflicts if multiple
parties try to allocate an identical address.

Building and Running
********************

These are instructions for how to use this sample application running
on a :ref:`frdm_k64f` board to configure a link local IPv4 address and
connect to a Linux host.

Connect ethernet cable from a :ref:`Freedom-K64F board <frdm_k64f>` to a Linux
host machine and check for new interfaces.

Running Avahi client in Linux Host
==================================

Assign a IPv4 link local address to the interface in the Linux system

.. code-block:: console

   $ avahi-autoipd --force-bind -D eth0


FRDM_K64F
=========

Build Zephyr the ``samples/net/ipv4_autoconf`` application using these
steps:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/net/ipv4_autoconf
   :host-os: unix
   :board: frdm_k64f
   :goals: build flash
   :compact:

Once IPv4 LL has completed probing and announcement, details are shown like this:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200

.. code-block:: console

   [ipv4ll] [INF] main: Run ipv4 autoconf client
   [ipv4ll] [INF] handler: Your address: 169.254.218.128

Note that the IP address may change at each self assignment.

To verify the Zephyr application is running and has configured an IP address
type:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ping -I eth1 169.254.218.128
