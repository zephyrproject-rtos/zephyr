   :name: OpenAMP DSP AMP Sample
   :relevant-api: ipm_interface

   Send messages between multiple cores using OpenAMP with concurrent communication channels.

Overview
********

This application demonstrates how to use OpenAMP for multi-core communication on NXP RT700
series processors. It showcases concurrent OpenAMP communication from a primary core (CM33_0)
to multiple remote cores:

- **CM33_0 ↔ CM33_1**: Inter-processor communication between Cortex-M33 cores
- **CM33_0 ↔ HiFi4 DSP**: Communication between ARM Cortex-M33 and Cadence HiFi4 DSP

The application demonstrates:

- Multiple concurrent OpenAMP/RPMSG instances
- Separate shared memory regions for each communication channel
- Independent message passing with different remote cores
- Proper resource isolation and synchronization

Architecture
************

The sample consists of three separate applications:

1. **Primary Core (CM33_0)**:
   - Runs two concurrent threads
   - Manages communication with both CM33_1 and HiFi4 DSP
   - Acts as RPMSG host for both channels

2. **Remote CM33 Core (CM33_1)**:
   - Runs as RPMSG remote
   - Communicates with CM33_0 via dedicated shared memory

3. **Remote DSP Core (HiFi4)**:
   - Runs as RPMSG remote
   - Communicates with CM33_0 via separate shared memory region

Open a serial terminal (minicom, putty, etc.) and connect the board with the
following settings:

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1

Reset the board and the following message will appear on the corresponding
serial port, one is master another is remote:

Key Features
************

- **Concurrent Communication**: Primary core manages two independent OpenAMP channels simultaneously
- **Resource Isolation**: Each communication channel uses separate shared memory regions and IPM instances
- **Multi-Architecture Support**: Demonstrates ARM Cortex-M33 to Cortex-M33 and ARM to DSP communication
- **Scalable Design**: Architecture can be extended to support additional remote cores

Technical Details
*****************

The implementation uses:

- Separate RPMSG virtio devices for each communication channel
- Independent shared memory pools and regions
- Dedicated IPM (Inter-Processor Messaging) instances
- Proper OpenAMP resource management and cleanup

This sample serves as a reference for implementing complex multi-core communication
scenarios in embedded systems using the OpenAMP framework.
