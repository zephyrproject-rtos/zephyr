Expose ST BlueNRG Bluetooth network coprocessor over UART

Overview
*********

Expose the Bluetooth network coprocessor via UART to a PC to be used
with the ST BlueNRG GUI app. In this case, the main MCU becomes an intermediate level,
and it passes the data between the host (PC) and controller.

Requirements
************

* A board based on BlueNRG BLE module such as :ref:`disco_l475_iot1_board`
* `BlueNRG GUI`_ application installed on your PC

Default UART settings
*********************

It depends on the board default settings for ``zephyr,bt-c2h-uart`` DTS property.
The UART default settings are:

* Baudrate: 115200 bps
* 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

Building and Running
********************

This sample can be found under :zephyr_file:`samples/boards/stm32/bluetooth/interactive_gui` in the
Zephyr tree.
