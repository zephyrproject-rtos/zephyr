config EXAMPLE_EXT1_WAKEUP
	bool "Enable wakeup from GPIO"
	depends on !SOC_SERIES_ESP32C3
	select GPIO
	help
	  This option enables wake-up from deep sleep using GPIO2 and
	  GPIO4. The sample enables internal pull-down on EXT1 pins to
	  avoid random wake-ups. Otherwise, external pull-down should
	  be used for the same purpose. To trigger a wake-up, connect
	  one or both of the pins to HIGH.

config EXAMPLE_GPIO_WAKEUP
	bool "Enable wakeup from GPIO"
	depends on SOC_SERIES_ESP32C3
	select GPIO
	help
	  This option enables wake-up from GPIO. Only GPIO0~5 can be used
	  as wake-up source. Be aware that when low level is used to trigger
	  wake-up, an external pull-up resistance is necessary.

config EXAMPLE_WAKEUP_TIME_SEC
	int "Wakeup time in seconds"
	default 5
	help
	  This option sets the time in seconds after which the device
	  will wake up from deep sleep. The value must be greater than 0.
