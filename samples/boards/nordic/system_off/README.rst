.. zephyr:code-sample:: nrf_system_off
   :name: System Off
   :relevant-api: sys_poweroff subsys_pm_device

   Use deep sleep on Nordic platforms.

Overview
********

This sample can be used for basic power measurement and as an example of
deep sleep on Nordic platforms.

RAM Retention
=============

This sample can also demonstrate RAM retention.
By selecting ``CONFIG_APP_USE_RETAINED_MEM=y`` state related to number of boots,
number of times system off was entered, and total uptime since initial power-on
are retained in a checksummed data structure.
RAM is configured to keep the containing section powered while in system-off mode.

Requirements
************

This application uses nRF51 DK, nRF52 DK or nRF54L15 DK board for the demo.
