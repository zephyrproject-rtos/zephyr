.. zephyr:code-sample:: uart
   :name: UART circular mode
   :relevant-api: uart_interface

   Read data from the console and echo it back using a circular dma configuration.

Overview
********

This sample demonstrates how to use STM32 UART serial driver with DMA in circular mode.
It reads data from the console and echoes it back.

By default, the UART peripheral that is normally assigned to the Zephyr shell
is used, hence the majority of boards should be able to run this sample.

Building and Running
********************

Build and flash the sample as follows, changing ``nucleo_g071rb`` for
your board:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/boards/st/uart/circular_dma
   :board: nucleo_g071rb
   :goals: build flash
   :compact:

Sample Output
=============

.. code-block:: console

    Enter message to fill RX buffer size and press enter :
    # Type e.g. :
