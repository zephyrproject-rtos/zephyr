	 *
	 * A] Extend the default period by setting a prescaler.
	 *    New period = 2sec * st,prescaler
	 *    Check the lptim bindings to see the impact on CONFIG_SYS_CLOCK_TICKS_PER_SEC
	 *    and LPTIM precision.
	 * B] Provide the LPTIM timeout definition.
	 *    In this case New period = st,timeout
	 *    Then st,prescaler should be defined with the following constraint:
	 *    st,timeout < st,prescaler * 2
