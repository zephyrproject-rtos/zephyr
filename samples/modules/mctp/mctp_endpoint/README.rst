.. zephyr:code-sample:: mctp_endpoint_sample
   :name: MCTP Endpoint Sample

   Create an MCTP endpoint over UART.

Overview
********
Sets up an MCTP node that listens on a UART for messages targeting a particular
MCTP endpoint id with the message "hello". Responds to this "hello" message with
"world".

Requirements
************
A board and SoC that provide access to a UART and a driver that implements the
UART async API.

Wiring
******
The listening UART pins should be wired to a board which will run the MCTP host
sample such that this board's UART tx pin connects to the host board's rx pin,
and this board's UART rx pin connects to the host board's tx pin. The boards'
grounds should also be wired together.

Optionally a logic analyzer can be wired up and listening to the UART to inspect
the data flowing.
