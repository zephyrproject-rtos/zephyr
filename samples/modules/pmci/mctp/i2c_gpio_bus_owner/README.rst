   :name: MCTP I2C GPIO Top Node Sample

   Create an MCTP top node controlling I2C with GPIO signaling.

Overview
********
Sets up an MCTP top node that may talk to any number of connected endpoints over I2C.

Requirements
************
Board with an I2C and number of GPIOs used for triggering by each bus connected endpoint.

Wiring
******
A common I2C bus SDA/SCL pair connected to any number of boards (setup in devicetree)
along with a GPIO per board for signaling endpoint write requests.
