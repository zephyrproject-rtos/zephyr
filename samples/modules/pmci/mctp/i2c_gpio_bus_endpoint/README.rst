   :name: MCTP I2C GPIO Endpoint Node Sample

   Create an MCTP endpoint node controlling I2C with GPIO signaling.

Overview
********
Sets up an MCTP endpoint node that may talk to a top node and peer to other MCTP endpoints.

Requirements
************
Board with an I2C and a GPIO used for signaling the top node to read the target device.

Wiring
******
A common I2C bus SDA/SCL pair connected to any number of boards (setup in devicetree)
along with a GPIO for signaling endpoint write requests.
