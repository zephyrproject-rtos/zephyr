This is a sample app which blinks a LED using PWM.

The LED will start at a blinking frequency of 0.5Hz. Every 4 seconds,
the blinking frequency will double. When the blinking frequency
reaches 500Hz, the blinking frequency will be halved every 4 seconds
until the blinking frequency reaches 0.5Hz. This completes a whole
blinking cycle. From now on, the LED will repeat the blinking cycle
for ever.

Arduino 101 and Quark D2000 CRB
===========
You will need to connect the LED to ground and PWM0 via the shield.
You may need a current limiting resistor. See your LED datasheet.
