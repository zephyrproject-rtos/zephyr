   :name: Native TTY UART
   :relevant-api: uart_interface

   Use native TTY driver to send and receive data between two UART-to-USB bridge dongles.

Overview
********

This sample demonstrates the usage of the Native TTY UART driver. It uses two
UART to USB bridge dongles that are wired together, writing demo data to one
dongle and reading it from the other."

The source code for this sample application can be found at:
:zephyr_file:`samples/drivers/uart/native_tty`.

You can learn more about the Native TTY UART driver in the
:ref:`TTY UART <native_tty_uart>` section of the native_sim board
documentation.

Requirements
************

#. Two UART to USB bridge dongles. Each dongle must have its TX pin wired to the
   other dongle's RX pin. The ground connection is not needed. Both dongles must
   be plugged into the host machine.
#. The DT overlay provided with the sample expects the dongles to appear as
   ``/dev/ttyUSB0`` and ``/dev/ttyUSB1`` in the system. You can check what they
   are in your system by running the command ``ls -l /dev/tty*``. If that is not
   the case on your machine you can either change the ``serial-port`` properties
   in the ``boards/native_sim.overlay`` file or using the command line options
   ``-uart_port`` and ``-uart_port2``.
