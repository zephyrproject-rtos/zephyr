.. zephyr:code-sample:: lora-receive
   :name: LoRa receive
   :relevant-api: lora_api

   Receive packets in both synchronous and asynchronous mode using the LoRa
   radio.

Overview
********

This sample demonstrates how to use the LoRa radio driver to receive packets
both synchronously and asynchronously.

In order to successfully receive messages, build and flash the accompanying
LoRa send sample :zephyr:code-sample:`lora-send` on another board within range.

As this sample receives a finite number of packets and then sleeps infinitely,
the user must be ready to inspect the console output immediately after
resetting the device.

Building and Running
********************

Build and flash the sample as follows, changing ``b_l072z_lrwan1`` for
your board, where your board has a ``lora0`` alias in the devicetree.
