config LED_ROW_COUNT
	int "Number of rows in IS31FL3743 matrix"
	default 11
	help
	  Set this to match the number of SW LED sink connections
	  wired up to your IS31FL3743 LED driver. The sample will only attempt
	  to drive LEDs within this range.

	default 18
	help
	  Set this to match the number of CS LED source connections wired up
