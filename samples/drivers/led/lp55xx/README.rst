   Control RGB LEDs connected to an LP5562/5521 driver chip.

Overview
********

This sample controls RGB LEDs connected to a TI LP5562/5521 driver,
using the following pattern:

 1. turn on LEDs to be red
 2. turn on LEDs to be green
 3. turn on LEDs to be blue
 4. turn on LEDs to be white
 5. turn on LEDs to be yellow
 6. turn on LEDs to be purple
 7. turn on LEDs to be cyan
 8. turn on LEDs to be orange
 9. turn off LEDs
 10. blink the LEDs in white (using RGB)
 11. turn off LEDs
 12. blink the LEDs in purple
 13. turn off LEDs

Refer to the `LP5562 Manual`_ or `LP5521 Manual`_ for the RGB LED connections and color channel
mappings used by this sample depending on the driver(s) used.
