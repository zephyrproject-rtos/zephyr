    This binding provides MEC172x board gpio power rails resources to
    build and run samples/drives/espi in Zephyr.
    GPIOs required before performing a eSPI host-slave handshake

properties:
  pwrg-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true

    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      Board GPIO output used to notify eSPI master to ackwnowledge
      power has stabilized and bare minimum initialization in eSPI slave
      is complete so eSPI master can proceed with eSPI handshake.
