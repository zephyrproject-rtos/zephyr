    This binding provides MEC15xx board gpio power rails resources to
    build and run samples/drives/espi in Zephyr.
    GPIOs required before performing a eSPI host-slave handshake

properties:

        type: phandle-array
        required: true

        description: |
          Board GPIO output used to notify eSPI master to ackwnowledge
          power has stabilized and bare minimum initialization in eSPI slave
          is complete so eSPI master can proceed with eSPI handshake.
