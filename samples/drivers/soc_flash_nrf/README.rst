.. zephyr:code-sample:: soc-flash-nrf
   :name: nRF SoC Internal Storage
   :relevant-api: flash_interface flash_area_api

   Use the flash API to interact with the SoC flash.

Overview
********

This sample demonstrates using the :ref:`Flash API <flash_api>` on an SoC internal storage.
The sample uses :ref:`Flash map API <flash_map_api>` to obtain a device that has
partition defined with label `storage_partition`, then uses :ref:`Flash API <flash_api>`
to directly access and modify contents of a device, within area defined for said
partition.

Within the sample, user may observe how read/write/erase operations
are performed on a device, and how to first check whether device is
ready for operation.

Building and Running
********************

The application will build for any SoC with internal storage
access enabled, as it is default for SoC devices with defined
fixed-partition, over that internal storage, labeled `storage_partition`.

   Test 7: Page layout API
      Offset  0x00041234:
        belongs to the page 65 of start offset 0x00041000
        and the size of 0x00001000 B.
      Page of number 37 has start offset 0x00025000
        and size of 0x00001000 B.
        Page index resolved properly
      SoC flash consists of 256 pages.

   Test 8: Write block size API
      write-block-size = 1

   Finished!
