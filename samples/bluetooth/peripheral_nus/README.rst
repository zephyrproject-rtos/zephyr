   :name: Peripheral NUS
   :relevant-api: bluetooth

   Implement a simple echo server using the Nordic UART Service (NUS).

Overview
********

This sample demonstrates the usage of the NUS service (Nordic UART Service) as a serial
endpoint to exchange data. In this case, the sample assumes the data is UTF-8 encoded,
but it may be binary data. Once the user connects to the device and subscribes to the TX
characteristic, it will start receiving periodic notifications with "Hello World!\n".

Requirements
************

* BlueZ running on the host, or
* A board with Bluetooth LE support

Building and Running

See :zephyr:code-sample-category:`bluetooth` samples for details.
