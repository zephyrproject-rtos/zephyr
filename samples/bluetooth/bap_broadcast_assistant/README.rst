   Use LE Audio Broadcast Assistant functionality

Overview
********

Application demonstrating the LE Audio broadcast assistant functionality.

The sample will automatically try to connect to a device in the BAP Scan Delegator
role (advertising support for the Broadcast Audio Scan Service (BASS)).
It will then search for a broadcast source and (if found) add the broadcast ID to
the BAP Scan Delegator.

Practical use of this sample requires a sink (e.g. the Broadcast Audio Sink sample or
a set of LE Audio Broadcast capable earbuds) and a source (e.g. the Broadcast Audio
Source sample).

This sample can be found under
:zephyr_file:`samples/bluetooth/bap_broadcast_assistant` in the Zephyr tree.

Check the :ref:`bluetooth samples section <bluetooth-samples>` for general information.

Requirements
************

* BlueZ running on the host, or
* A board with Bluetooth Low Energy 5.2 support
* Broadcast Audio Source and Sink devices

Building and Running
********************

The application will act as a broadcast assistant with optionally preconfigured
filtering of broadcast sink and broadcast source names. By default, the application will
search for and connect to the first broadcast audio sink found (advertising PACS and
BASS UUIDs) and then search for and select the first broadcast audio source found
(advertising a broadcast ID).

Filter these by modifying the following configs:

``CONFIG_SELECT_SINK_NAME``: Substring of BT name of the sink.

and

``CONFIG_SELECT_SOURCE_NAME``: Substring of BT name or broadcast name of the source.
