   :name: Isochronous Broadcaster Benchmark
   :relevant-api: bt_iso bluetooth

   Measure packet loss and sync loss of an ISO broadcaster against one or more receivers.

The ISO Broadcast Benchmark sample measures and report packet loss and sync loss
of an ISO broadcaster against one or more ISO broadcast receivers.

Overview
********

The sample transmits data from the *broadcaster* to the
*receiver* (multiple receivers may be used with no effect on the test)
and measures the quality of the sync.

The application is used as both a broadcaster and a receiver, and the mode
can easily be changed.

Requirements
************

* BlueZ running on the host, or
* A board with Bluetooth Low Energy 5.2 support
* A Bluetooth Controller and board that supports setting
  CONFIG_BT_CTLR_ADV_ISO=y
* A remote board running the same sample as the reversed role that supports
  setting CONFIG_BT_CTLR_SYNC_ISO

Building and running
********************

See :zephyr:code-sample-category:`bluetooth` samples for details.


Testing
=======

After programming the sample to both boards, test it by performing the following
steps:

1. Connect to both boards with a terminal emulator (for example, PuTTY or
   minicom).
#. Reset both boards.
#. In one of the terminal emulators, type "r" to start the application on the
   connected board in the receiver role.
#. In the other terminal emulator, type "b" to start the application in the
   broadcaster role.
#. Optionally modify the broadcasting settings.
#. Observe that the receiver synchronizes to the broadcaster.
#. Observe the receive statistics on the receiver(s).

Sample output
==============
The receiver will output statistics for overall (since boot), current sync
(since the BIG was synced) and latest 1000 received packets::

The broadcaster will ask if any changes to the current settings are wanted.
If y/Y is chosen, then it will create a prompt to enter changes to the settings,
otherwise continue with the current settings. The broadcaster will then start
the BIG and output the current counter (since the BIG was created)::
