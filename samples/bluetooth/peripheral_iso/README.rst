Bluetooth: Peripheral ISO
#########################

Overview
********

This sample demonstrates how to use isochronous channels as a peripheral.
The sample starts advertising, waits for a central to connect to it and set up an isochronous channel.
Once the isochronous channel is set up, received isochronous data is printed out.
It is recommended to run this sample together with the :ref:`Bluetooth: Central ISO <bluetooth_central_iso>` sample.

Requirements
************

* BlueZ running on the host, or
* A board with Bluetooth Low Energy 5.2 support
* A Bluetooth Controller and board that supports setting
  CONFIG_BT_CTLR_PERIPHERAL_ISO=y

Building and Running
********************

This sample can be found under :zephyr_file:`samples/bluetooth/peripheral_iso` in the Zephyr tree.

1. Start the application.
   In the terminal window, check that it is advertising.

      Bluetooth initialized
      Advertising successfully started

2. Observe that the central device connects and sets up an isochronous channel.
