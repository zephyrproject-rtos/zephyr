   Implement the TMAP Call Terminal (CT) and Unicast Media Receiver (UMR) roles.

Overview
********

Application demonstrating the TMAP peripheral functionality. Implements the CT and UMR roles.

Requirements
************

* A board with Bluetooth Low Energy 5.2 support

Building and Running
********************

Build and flash the sample as follows, replacing ``<board>`` with your target
board (e.g. :zephyr:board:`nrf5340dk`):

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/bluetooth/tmap_peripheral
   :board: <board>
   :goals: build flash
   :compact:

After flashing, the sample initializes the TMAP Call Terminal (CT) and Unicast
Media Receiver (UMR) roles, then starts advertising as ``TMAP Peripheral``.
After a TMAP Central connects and security is established, the sample discovers
the peer's TMAP role: if the peer is a Call Gateway (CG), it sends an "originate call" request
and terminates it after 2 seconds; if the peer is a Unicast Media Sender (UMS),
it sends a "play media" request and pauses after 2 seconds.

Use the :zephyr:code-sample:`ble_peripheral_tmap_central` sample on another
board to act as the TMAP Central (CG and UMS roles).

See :zephyr:code-sample-category:`bluetooth` samples for details.
