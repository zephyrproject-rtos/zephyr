sample:
  name: Bluetooth HCI UART Async
  description:
    This sample is a batteries-included example of a Bluetooth HCI UART
    connectivity chip.

    It demonstrates a possible implementation of an HCI UART (H4)
    interface on top of Zephyr's Bluetooth Raw API, and how to expose it
    over a UART.

    This implementation is based on the Zephyr Asynchoronous UART API.
