	  Enable support for STM32 STOP3 low-power mode.
	  Based on the Cortex-M33 Deepsleep mode combined with peripheral clock gating.
	  All clocks in the core domain are stopped.
	  The PLL, MSIS, MSIK, HSI16, and HSE oscillators are disabled.
	  All SRAMs and register contents are preserved.
	  SRAMs can be totally or partially switched off to further reduce consumption.
	  GPIOs are left floating and additional pull-up or pull-down can be applied
	  via PWR registers.
