config USE_STM32_ASSERT
	depends on ASSERT
	bool "STM32Cube HAL and LL drivers asserts"
	help
	  Enable asserts in STM32Cube HAL and LL drivers.

config STM32_BACKUP_SRAM
	bool "STM32 Backup SRAM"
	default y
	depends on DT_HAS_ST_STM32_BACKUP_SRAM_ENABLED
	help
	  Enable support for STM32 backup SRAM.

config STM32_BACKUP_SRAM_INIT_PRIORITY
	int "STM32 Backup SRAM init priority"
	default APPLICATION_INIT_PRIORITY
	depends on STM32_BACKUP_SRAM
	help
	  STM32 Backup SRAM device initialization priority.

config STM32_ENABLE_DEBUG_SLEEP_STOP
	bool "Allow debugger attach in stop/sleep Mode"
	default y if DEBUG
	help
	  Some STM32 parts disable the DBGMCU in sleep/stop modes because
	  of power consumption. As a side-effects this prevents
	  debuggers from attaching w/o resetting the target. This
	  effectively destroys the use-case of `west attach`. Also
	  SEGGER RTT and similar technologies need this.

config SWJ_ANALOG_PRIORITY
	int "SWJ DP port to analog routine initialization priority"
	default 49
	help
	  Initialization priority of the routine within the PRE_KERNEL1 level.
	  This priority must be greater than GPIO_INIT_PRIORITY and lower than
	  UART_INIT_PRIORITY.

config HAS_STM32_FLASH_PREFETCH
	bool
	help
	  Hidden symbol selected by SoCs which support flash prefetch.

config STM32_FLASH_PREFETCH
	bool "Flash prefetch buffer"
	default y
	depends on HAS_STM32_FLASH_PREFETCH
	help
	  Enable flash prefetch. For power efficiency, it is recommended to
	  be enabled when flash is accessed through a cache memory. Flash
	  prefetch also improves performances a bit.

config STM32_WKUP_PINS
	bool "STM32 PWR Wake-up Pins"
	depends on DT_HAS_ST_STM32_PWR_ENABLED
	help
	  Enable support for STM32 PWR wake-up pins.

config STM32_BACKUP_PROTECTION
	bool "SoC has backup domain protection access"
	help
	  Enabled for SoCs for which access protection to backup domain
	  resources needs to be explicitly handled.

config STM32_APP_IN_EXT_FLASH
	bool
	help
	  Allows the SoC clock driver to correctly initialize the
	  Q/O/XSPI controller clocks when the application is residing
	  in external Flash and is chainloaded with MCUboot.
	  Whether the app is eXecuted in Place (XiP) depends on the MCUboot mode used.
