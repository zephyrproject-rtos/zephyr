	  If enabled, Instruction Local Memory (ILM) will be configured to execute
	  code placed in the .__ram_code section out of RAM. This consumes RAM in
	  blocks of 4 kilobytes, but performance of code in ILM is much more
	  predictable than executing from Flash directly, and some code (such as code
	  that writes to the internal Flash) must execute out of RAM.
