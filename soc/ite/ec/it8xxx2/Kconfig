	  On IT81202 (128-pins package), the pins of GPIO group K and L aren't
	  bonding with pad. So we configure these pins as internal pull-down
	  at default to prevent leakage current due to floating.

	  On IT81202/IT81302, the GPIOH7 isn't bonding with pad and is left
	  floating internally. We need to enable internal pull-down for the pin
	  to prevent leakage current, but IT81202/IT81302 doesn't have the
	  capability to pull it down. We can only set it as output low,
	  so we enable output low for it at initialization to prevent leakage.

	bool
	default y
	help
	  If enabled, Instruction Local Memory (ILM) will be configured to execute
	  code placed in the .__ram_code section out of RAM. This consumes RAM in
	  blocks of 4 kilobytes, but performance of code in ILM is much more
	  predictable than executing from Flash directly, and some code (such as code
	  that writes to the internal Flash) must execute out of RAM.

	  Place exception handling (ISR entry/exit and related) code in ILM, which
	  has more reliable performance characteristics than executing directly from
	  Flash. This can significantly improve performance when under I-cache
	  pressure.
