config ESP32_USE_UNSUPPORTED_REVISION
	bool "Use unsupported ESP32 revision (Rev 0/1)"
	help
	  ESP32 SoC has multiple revisions, some of which are not supported by the current
	  implementation, as such as REV0 and REV1. In case those revisions are required,
	  set this option to enable support for them. Note that this is not recommended and
	  may lead to unexpected behavior.

	  The Simple Boot is a booting method that doesn't need a 2nd stage bootloader.
	  Output is a single image that should be flashed at a offset defined by used SOC.
	  Please note that this method brings the system up with all memories set-up, but
	  all other features, such as secure boot OTA or slots management are not available.

	  Enabling this will allocate SRAM area starting by a last linked data at symbolic `_end`,
	  ending by a last memory location that can be safely accesed (depending on a boot mode).
	  This is a memory pool used in runtime to create a new heap memory.
