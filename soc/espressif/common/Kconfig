config ESP32_USE_UNSUPPORTED_REVISION
	bool "Use unsupported ESP32 revision (Rev 0/1)"
	help
	  ESP32 SoC has multiple revisions, some of which are not supported by the current
	  implementation, as such as REV0 and REV1. In case those revisions are required,
	  set this option to enable support for them. Note that this is not recommended and
	  may lead to unexpected behavior.

	help
	  The Simple Boot is a booting method that doesn't need a 2nd stage bootloader.
	  Output is a single image that should be flashed at an offset defined by used SOC.
	  Please note that this method brings the system up with all memories set-up, but
	  all other features, such as secure boot OTA or slots management are not available.

	int "Stack size of the high resolution ESP Timer"

	help
	  Set the stack size for the internal high resolution ESP Timer
	  used in Wi-Fi and BLE peripherals.

config ESP32_TIMER_TASK_PRIO
	int "Task priority of the high resolution ESP Timer"

	  Set maximum transmit power for Wi-Fi radio. Actual transmit power for high
	  data rates may be lower than this setting.

config ESP32_SW_COEXIST_ENABLE
	bool "Software controls Wi-Fi/Bluetooth coexistence"
	default y if (BT_ESP32 && WIFI_ESP32)
	help
	  If enabled, Wi-Fi & Bluetooth coexistence is controlled by software rather than hardware.
	  Recommended for heavy traffic scenarios. Both coexistence configuration options are
	  automatically managed, no user intervention is required.
	  If only Bluetooth is used, it is recommended to disable this option to reduce binary file
	  size.
