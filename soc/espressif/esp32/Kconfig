	  ESP32 has two banks of size 192K and 128K which can be used
	  as DRAM. Enabling this option would allocate .noinit sections

	help
	  When ESP32 exits deep sleep, the CPU and the flash chip are powered on
	  at the same time. CPU will run deep sleep stub first, and then
	  proceed to load code from flash. Some flash chips need sufficient
	  time to pass between power on and first read operation. By default,
	  without any extra delay, this time is approximately 900us, although
	  some flash chip types need more than that.

	  By default extra delay is set to 2000us. When optimizing startup time
	  for applications which require it, this value may be reduced.

	  If you are seeing "flash read err, 1000" message printed to the
	  console after deep sleep reset, try increasing this value.
