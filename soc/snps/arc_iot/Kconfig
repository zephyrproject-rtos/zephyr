	  The ARC IoT SoC has a hardware limitation where entering sleep mode
	  causes peripherals (e.g., UART) to lose power, preventing wake-up
	  from peripheral interrupts. Enable this option to use a custom idle
	  implementation that skips sleep, keeping peripherals powered.
	  Enable for tests that require continuous UART operation during idle.
