config SOC_FAMILY

config HP_SRAM_RESERVE
	int "Bytes to reserve at start of HP-SRAM"
	default 65536
	help
	  Bytes to reserve at the start of HP-SRAM.  Zephyr will not
	  place any symbols here, though the host windows have
	  addresses here.  The SOF application also makes direct use
	  of this region, so be very careful changing this value.

config ADSP_WIN0_OFFSET
	int "Byte offset of host window zero"
	default 16384
	help
	  Offset of the first host shared memory window (used for the
	  "firmware status register" at boot) within the reserved
	  region at the start of HP-SRAM.

config ADSP_WIN3_OFFSET
	int "Byte offset of host window three"
	default 40960
	help
	  Offset of the fourth host shared memory window (used for
	  printk/log output) within the reserved region at the start
	  of HP-SRAM.

config IMR_MANIFEST_ADDR
	hex "Address of boot manifest struct within IMR memory"
	default 0xb0032000
	help
	  Address where the rimage manifest struct is placed upon
	  boot.  Must be synchronized between Zephyr's linkage, the
	  hardware, ROM and rimage configuration.  Don't touch except
	  with great care.

config IMR_DATA_ADDR
	hex "Address of bootloader .data section within IMR memory"
	default 0xb0039000
	help
	  Location to place .data contents in IMR memory during
	  bootloader linkage.
