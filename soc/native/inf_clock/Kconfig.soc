	  SOC for to the POSIX arch. It emulates a CPU running at an infinitely fast
	  clock. That means the CPU will always run in zero time until completion after
	  each wake reason (e.g. interrupts), before going back to idle. Note that an
	  infinite loop in the code which does not sleep the CPU will cause the process
	  to appear "hung", as simulated time does not advance while the CPU does not
	  sleep. Therefore do not use busy waits while waiting for something to happen
	  (if needed use k_busy_wait()).
	  Note that the interrupt handling is provided by the board.
