	help
	  Issues have been observed while attempting to attach a debugger.
	  These can be mitigated by inserting a small delay during the early boot
	  sequence, before the system clock is configured.

	  If you ever intend to attach a debugger, say y.
	  If you are confident that you will never attach a debugger to the
	  resulting binary, or require the best possible boot time, say n.

	help
	  As detailed in DS70005356C, LoRa radio SPI pins do not have pull-ups,
	  so when the radio is not in use, it's important that CS is kept high,
	  to avoid unexpected behavior and increased current consumption. To
	  further reduce power consumption, radio can be kept in reset state by
	  keeping nRST pin low. When enabling this option, both CS and nRST will
	  be configured high and low, respectively.
