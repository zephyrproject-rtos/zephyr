config	NETWORKING
	bool
	prompt "Generic networkig support [EXPERIMENTAL]"
	default n
	help
	  This option enabled generic networking support.

config	NETWORKING_WITH_6LOWPAN
	bool
	prompt "Enable 6LoWPAN (IPv6 compression) in the uIP stack"
	depends on NETWORKING
	default n
	help
	  Enable 6LoWPAN in uIP stack

config	NETWORKING_WITH_RPL
	bool
	prompt "Enable RPL (ripple) IPv6 mesh routing protocol"
	depends on NETWORKING
	default n
	help
	  Enable RPL (RFC 6550) IPv6 Routing Protocol for
	  Low-Power and Lossy Networks.

config	NETWORKING_WITH_LOGGING
	bool
	prompt "Enable logging of the uIP stack"
	depends on NETWORKING
	default n
	help
	  Enable packet and uIP stack logging

config	NETWORKING_WITH_LOOPBACK
	bool
	prompt "Enable loopback driver"
	depends on NETWORKING
	default n
	help
	  Enable a simple loopback driver that installs
	  IPv6 loopback addresses into routing table and
	  neighbor cache. All packets transmitted are
	  looped back to the receiving fifo/fiber.

config	NETWORKING_UART
	bool
	prompt "Network UART/slip driver"
	depends on NETWORKING
	select UART_SIMPLE
	default n
	help
	  Enable UART driver for passing IPv6 packets using slip.
	  This requires running tunslip6 tool in host. See README
	  file at net/ip/contiki/tools directory for details.

config	NETWORKING_DEBUG_UART
	bool
	prompt "Network UART driver debug"
	depends on NETWORKING_UART && NETWORKING_WITH_LOGGING
	default n
	help
	  This option enables debug support for network UART
	  driver.
