config  NET_L2_DUMMY
	bool "Enable dummy l2 layer"
	default n
	default y if !NET_L2_ETHERNET && NET_SLIP
	help
	  Add a dummy L2 layer driver, usually in case you need SLIP in
	  TUN mode.

config  NET_L2_ETHERNET
	bool "Enable ethernet support"
	default n
	help
         Add suport for Ethernet, enabling selecting relevant hardware drivers.
	 If NET_SLIP and SLIP_TAP are selected, NET_L2_ETHERNET will enable to
	 fully simulate ethernet through SLIP.

config NET_ARP
       bool "Enable ARP"
       default y
       depends on NET_IPV4 && NET_L2_ETHERNET
       help
         Enable ARP support. This is necessary on hardware that requires it to
	 get IPv4 working (like Ethernet devices).

config NET_ARP_TABLE_SIZE
       int "Number of entries in ARP table."
       depends on NET_ARP
       default 2
       help
         Each entry in the ARP table consumes 22 bytes of memory.
