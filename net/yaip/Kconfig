       depends on NET_IPV6
       default y
       default n if !NET_IPV6_ND

config NET_IPV4
       bool "Enable IPv4"
       default n
       help
         Enable IPv4 support. If this is enabled then the device is
	 able to send and receive IPv4 network packets.

config NET_INITIAL_TTL
       int "Initial time to live for a connection"
       depends on NET_IPV4

       range 1 254
       help
         The value depends on your network needs.

config NET_UDP
       bool "Enable UDP"
       default y
       help
         The value depends on your network needs.

config NET_MAX_CONN
       int "How many network connections are supported"
       depends on NET_UDP || NET_TCP
       default 4
       help
         The value depends on your network needs. The value
         should include both UDP and TCP connections.

config NET_CONN_CACHE
       bool "Cache network connections"
       depends on NET_UDP || NET_TCP
       default n
       help
         Caching takes slight more memory but will speedup connection
         handling of UDP and TCP connections.

config NET_TX_STACK_SIZE
	int "TX fiber stack size"
	default 1024
	help
	  Set the TX fiber stack size in bytes. The TX fiber is waiting
	  data from application. Each network interface will start one
	  TX fiber for sending network packets destined to it.

config NET_RX_STACK_SIZE
	int "RX fiber stack size"
	default 1200
	help
	  Set the RX fiber stack size in bytes. The RX fiber is waiting
	  data from network. There is one RX fiber in the system.

config NET_NBUF_RX_COUNT
	int "How many network receives can be pending at the same time"
	default 2
	help
	  Each RX buffer will occupy smallish amount of memory.
	  See include/net/nbuf.h and the sizeof(struct nbuf)

config NET_NBUF_TX_COUNT
	int "How many network sends can be pending at the same time"
	default 2
	help
	  Each TX buffer will occupy smallish amount of memory.
	  See include/net/nbuf.h and the sizeof(struct nbuf)

config NET_NBUF_DATA_COUNT
	int "How many network data buffers are allocated"
	default 16
	help
	  Each data buffer will occupy CONFIG_NBUF_DATA_SIZE + smallish
	  header (sizeof(struct net_buf)) amount of data.

config NET_NBUF_DATA_SIZE
	int "Size of each network data fragment"
	default 128
	help
	  This value tells what is the size of the data fragment that is
	  received from the network.
	  Example: For IEEE 802.15.4, the network packet is 127 bytes long,
	  which leaves in worst case 81 bytes for user data (MTU).
	  In order to be able to receive at least full IPv6 packet which
	  has a size of 1280 bytes, the one should allocate 16 fragments here.

config NET_MAX_CONTEXTS
	int "Number of network contexts to allocate"
	default 2
	help
	  Each network context is used to describe a network 5-tuple that
	  is used when listening or sending network traffic. This is very
	  similar as one could call a network socket in some other systems.

config NET_CONTEXT_SYNC_RECV
	bool "Support synchronous functionality in net_context_recv() API"
	default y
	help
	  You can disable sync support to save some memory if you are calling
	  net_context_recv() in async way only when timeout is set to 0.

config NET_CONTEXT_CHECK
	bool "Check options when calling various net_context functions"
	default y
	help
	  If you know that the options passed to net_context...() functions
	  are ok, then you can disable the checks to save some memory.

config NET_SLIP
       bool "Use SLIP connectivity with Qemu"
       default n
       select SLIP
       select UART_PIPE
       select UART_INTERRUPT_DRIVEN
       help
	  The SLIP support is only used when the application is
	  run inside Qemu and the network peer is run in your
	  host. The host needs to have tunslip running in order
	  to receive and send network packets via the SLIP driver.
	  The SLIP driver Kconfig options can be tweaked in drivers
	  section.

config NET_STATISTICS
       bool "Print network statistics"
       default n
       help
	  Print network send/receive statistics to console.
	  This takes memory so say 'n' if unsure.
