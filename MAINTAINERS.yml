# "Area title" (the quotes are only needed for titles with special characters,
#  like colons):
#     status:
#         One of the following:
#
#         * maintained:
#             The area has a Maintainer (approved by the TSC) who
#             looks after the area.
#
#         * odd fixes:
#            The area gets odd fixes and may have collaborators.
#
#         * obsolete:
#             Old code. Something being marked obsolete generally means it has
#             been replaced by something better that you should be using
#             instead.
#
#     maintainers:
#         List of GitHub handles for the people who maintain the area. Usually,
#         there's only one maintainer.
#
#     collaborators (not to be confused with the GitHub collaborator role):
#         Very involved contributors, who know the area well and contribute
#         significantly to it.
#
#     labels:
#         List of GitHub labels to add to pull requests that modify the area.
#
#     files:
#         List of paths and/or glob patterns giving the files in the area,
#         relative to the root directory.
#
#         If a path or glob pattern ends in a '/', it matches all files within
#         the given directory or directories. Otherwise, an exact match is
#         required.
#
#         Paths to directories should always have a trailing '/'.
#
#     files-regex:
#         List of regular expressions applied to paths to determine if they
#         belong to the area. The regular expression may match anywhere within
#         the path, but can be anchored with ^ and $ as usual.
#
#         Can be combined with a 'files' key.
#
#         Note: Prefer plain 'files' patterns where possible. get_maintainer.py
#         will check that they match some file, but won't check regexes
#         (because it might be slow).
#
#     files-exclude:
#         Like 'files', but any matching files will be excluded from the area.
#
#     files-regex-exclude:
#         Like 'files-regex', but any matching files will be excluded from the
#         area.
#
#     description: >-
#         Plain-English description. Describe what the system is about, from an
#         outsider's perspective.
#
#
# All areas must have a 'files' and/or 'files-regex' key. The other keys are
# optional.
#
# It is very advisable to have a `status` key in all entries. Exceptions to
# this would be sub-areas which add extra fields (for ex. more `collaborators`
# who work only in that sub-area) to other areas.
#
#
# Workflow
# ########
#
# Ideally, any file in the tree will be covered by some area.
#
# When a GitHub pull request is sent, this happens:
#
#     * A user mentioned in 'maintainers' is added as Assignee to
#       the pull request
#
#     * Users mentioned in 'maintainers' and 'collaborators' are added as
#       reviewers to the pull request
#
#     * The labels listed in 'labels' are automatically added to the pull
#       request
#
#     * The bot posts this comment:
#
#         This PR affects the following areas:
#         <area name>:
#           Status: ...
#           Maintainers: <list of maintainers>
#           Collaborators: <list of sub-maintainers>
#
#         <area name>:
#           ...
#
#
# Changes to MAINTAINERS.yml need to be approved as follows:
#
#     * Changing the 'maintainers' for an area needs approval from the
#       Technical Steering Committee
#
#     * Changing the 'collaborators' lines requires the maintainer and
#       collaborators of that area to agree (or vote on it)

# Areas are sorted by name
