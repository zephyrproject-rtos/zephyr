menuconfig MBEDTLS
	bool
	prompt "mbedTLS Support"
	default n
	help
	  This option enables the mbedTLS cryptography library.

if MBEDTLS

choice
	prompt "Select implementation"
	default MBEDTLS_BUILTIN

config MBEDTLS_BUILTIN
	bool "Enable mbedTLS integrated sources"
	help
	  Link with local mbedTLS sources instead of external library.

config MBEDTLS_LIBRARY
	bool "Enable mbedTLS external library"
	help
	  This option enables mbedTLS library.

endchoice

config MBEDTLS_CFG_FILE
	string "mbed TLS configuration file"
	depends on MBEDTLS_BUILTIN
	default "config-mini-tls1_2.h"
	help
	  Use a specific mbed TLS configuration file. The default is suitable to
	  communicate with majority of HTTPS servers on the Internet, but has
	  relatively many features enabled. To optimize resources for special
	  TLS usage, an alternative config may be selected.

config MBEDTLS_DEBUG
	bool "mbed TLS debug activation"
	depends on MBEDTLS_BUILTIN
	default n
	help
	  Enable debugging activation for mbed TLS configuration. Note that this
	  does not directly cause any debug print output. For that you need to
	  call
	  mbedtls_debug_set_threshold(level);
	  and
	  mbedtls_ssl_conf_dbg(&mbedtls.conf, my_debug, NULL);
	  functions in your application, and create the my_debug() function to
	  actually print something useful.

config MBEDTLS_TEST
	bool "Compile internal self test functions"
	depends on MBEDTLS_BUILTIN
	default n
	help
	  Enable self test function for the crypto algorithms

config MBEDTLS_INSTALL_PATH
	string "mbedTLS install path"
	depends on MBEDTLS_LIBRARY
	help
	  This option holds the path where the mbedTLS libraries and headers are
	  installed. Make sure this option is properly set when MBEDTLS_LIBRARY
	  is enabled otherwise the build will fail.

config MBEDTLS_ENABLE_HEAP
	bool "Enable global heap for mbed TLS"
	default n
	help
	  This option enables the mbedtls to use the heap. This setting must
	  be global so that various applications and libraries in Zephyr do not
	  try to do this themselves as there can be only one heap defined
	  in mbedtls. If this is enabled, then the Zephyr will, during the device
	  startup, initialize the heap automatically.

config MBEDTLS_HEAP_SIZE
	int "Heap size for mbed TLS"
	default 512
	depends on MBEDTLS_ENABLE_HEAP
	help
	  The mbedtls routines will use this heap if enabled.
	  See ext/lib/crypto/mbedtls/include/mbedtls/config.h and
	  MBEDTLS_MEMORY_BUFFER_ALLOC_C option for details. That option is not
	  enabled by default.
	  Default value for the heap size is not set as it depends on the
	  application. For server application 15000 bytes should be enough.
	  For some dedicated and specific usage of mbedtls API, the 1000 bytes
	  might be ok.

config APP_LINK_WITH_MBEDTLS
	bool "Link 'app' with MBEDTLS"
	default y
	depends on MBEDTLS
	help
	  Add MBEDTLS header files to the 'app' include path. It may be
	  disabled if the include paths for MBEDTLS are causing aliasing
	  issues for 'app'.
