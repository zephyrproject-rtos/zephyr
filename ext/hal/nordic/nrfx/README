Origin:
   https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrfx/tree/v1.1.0

Status:
   v1.1.0

Purpose:
   With added proper shims adapting it to Zephyr's APIs, nrfx will provide
   peripheral drivers for Nordic SoCs.

Description:
   nrfx is an extract from the nRF5 SDK that contains solely the drivers
   for peripherals present in Nordic SoCs, for convenience complemented with
   the MDK package containing required structures and bitfields definitions,
   startup files etc.

   Only relevant files from nrfx were imported, for instance, template files
   and the ones with startup code or strictly related to installation of IRQs
   in the vector table were omitted.

Dependencies:
   CMSIS header files
