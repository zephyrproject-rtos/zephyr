Patch List:

   *Current implementation of LL_SPI_TransmitData16 on F3/F7/L4 family
    generates following warning:
    "warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing
    rules [-Wstrict-aliasing]"
    Besides being forbidden by rule, this cast is not needed, as register is
    16 bits wide. Modification has been tested on L4 SoC.
    stm32yyxx_ll_spi.h being included in soc.h file, warning is generated
    at each compiled object, this commit allows a clean build.
    Impacted files:
     drivers/include/stm32f7xx_ll_spi.h
    ST Bug tracker ID: 13359

   *Add correct shifting to I2SR field in PLLI2SCFGR register
     The I2SR field should be shifted by RCC_PLLI2SCFGR_PLLI2SR_Pos when the PLLI2SCFGR register
     is read or written.
    Impacted files:
     drivers/include/stm32f7xx_ll_rcc.h
    ST Bug tracker ID: 50108


   *Disable new CAN API and enable Legacy API
     A new CAN API has been delivered on recent F7 stm32cube.
     This new API breaks current CAN driver. Disable the new API and enable the
     legacy API.
     Disable related systematic warning message
