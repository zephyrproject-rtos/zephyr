Patch List:

    * The STM32L4x2 SoCs need to control the isolation of the USB features
    from VDDUSB. This is done through the PWR_CR2 bit USV. The STM32L4 HAL
    in stm32l4xx_ll_pwr.h wrongly checks for the PWR_CR2_PVME1 bit, which
    is only available on Cat. 3 devices. Replace the check by PWR_CR2_USV.

   *Disable new CAN API and enable Legacy API
     A new CAN API has been delivered on recent L4 stm32cube.
     This new API breaks current CAN driver. Disable the new API and enable the
     legacy API.
