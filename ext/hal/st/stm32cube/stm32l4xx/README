Status:
   version 1.10.0

Purpose:
   ST Microelectronics official MCU package for STM32L4 series.

Description:
   This package is an extract of official STM32CubeL4 package written by ST Microelectronics.
   It is composed of STM32Cube hardware abstraction layer (HAL) and low layer (LL) plus a set
   of CMSIS headers files, one for each SoC in STM32L4 series.

Dependencies:
    None.

Patch List:

   *Current implementation of LL_SPI_TransmitData16 on F3/F7/L4 family
    generates following warning:
    "warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing
    rules [-Wstrict-aliasing]"
    Besides being forbidden by rule, this cast is not needed, as register is
    16 bits wide. Modification has been tested on L4 SoC.
    stm32yyxx_ll_spi.h being included in soc.h file, warning is generated
    at each compiled object, this commit allows a clean build.
    Impacted files:
     drivers/include/stm32l4xx_ll_spi.h
    ST Bug tracker ID: 13359

    * The STM32L4x2 SoCs need to control the isolation of the USB features
    from VDDUSB. This is done through the PWR_CR2 bit USV. The STM32L4 HAL
    in stm32l4xx_ll_pwr.h wrongly checks for the PWR_CR2_PVME1 bit, which
    is only available on Cat. 3 devices. Replace the check by PWR_CR2_USV.
