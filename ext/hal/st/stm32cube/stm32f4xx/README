Patch List:

   *Disable i2c HAL
     Due to conflict with zephyr i2c.h (I2C_SPEED_STANDARD and I2C_SPEED_FAST
     redefinition), deactivate STM32Cube I2C HAL. This raises no issue since
     LL API is currently used for stm32 I2C driver.
    Impacted files:
     drivers/include/stm32f4xx_hal_conf.h
    ST Bug tracker ID: NA. Not a stm32cube issue

   *Add correct shifting to I2SR field in PLLI2SCFGR register
     The I2SR field should be shifted by RCC_PLLI2SCFGR_PLLI2SR_Pos when the PLLI2SCFGR register
     is read or written.
    Impacted files:
     drivers/include/stm32f4xx_ll_rcc.h
    ST Bug tracker ID: 50086

   *Disable new CAN API and enable Legacy API
     A new CAN API has been delivered on recent F4 stm32cube.
     This new API breaks current CAN driver. Disable the new API and enable the
     legacy API.
     Disable related systematic warning message
