config BOARD
	string
	default "$(BOARD)"
	help
	  This option holds the name of the board and is used to locate the files
	  related to the board in the source tree (under boards/).
	  The Board is the first location where we search for a linker.ld file,
	  if not found we look for the linker file in
	  soc/<arch>/<family>/<series>

config BOARD_REVISION
	def_string "$(BOARD_REVISION)"
	help
	  If the BOARD has a revision field set, this is the revision.
	  Otherwise, it is the empty string. For example, if BOARD is
	  "plank@foo", this option will be "foo". If BOARD is "plank",
	  this option will be the empty string.

config BOARD_DEPRECATED_RELEASE
	string
	help
	  This hidden option is set in the board configuration and indicates
	  the Zephyr release that the board configuration will be removed.
	  When set, any build for that board will generate a clearly visible
	  deprecation warning.
