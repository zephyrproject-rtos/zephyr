	  The operating mode of MCUboot (which will also be propagated to the application).

config MCUBOOT_MODE_SINGLE_APP
	bool "Single slot"
	help
	  MCUboot will only boot slot0_partition placed application and does not care about other
	  slots. In this mode application is not able to DFU its own update to secondary slot and
	  all updates need to be performed using MCUboot serial recovery.

config MCUBOOT_MODE_SWAP_USING_OFFSET
	bool "Swap using offset"
	help
	  MCUboot expects slot0_partition and slot1_partition to be present in DT and application
	  will boot from slot0_partition. MCUBOOT_BOOTLOADER_NO_DOWNGRADE should also be selected
	  in main application if MCUboot has been built with MCUBOOT_DOWNGRADE_PREVENTION.

config MCUBOOT_MODE_SWAP_USING_MOVE
	bool "Swap using move"
	help
	  MCUboot expects slot0_partition and slot1_partition to be present in DT and application
	  will boot from slot0_partition. MCUBOOT_BOOTLOADER_NO_DOWNGRADE should also be selected
	  in main application if MCUboot has been built with MCUBOOT_DOWNGRADE_PREVENTION.

	help
	  This Kconfig is deprecated, use MCUBOOT_MODE_SWAP_USING_MOVE instead.

config MCUBOOT_MODE_SWAP_SCRATCH
	bool "Swap using scratch"
	help
	  MCUboot expects slot0_partition, slot1_partition and scratch_partition to be present in
	  DT, and application will boot from slot0_partition. In this mode scratch_partition is
	  used as temporary storage when MCUboot swaps application from the secondary slot to the
	  primary slot.
	  MCUBOOT_BOOTLOADER_NO_DOWNGRADE should also be selected in main application if MCUboot
	  has been built with MCUBOOT_DOWNGRADE_PREVENTION.

config MCUBOOT_MODE_OVERWRITE_ONLY
	bool "Overwrite"
	help
	  MCUboot will take contents of secondary slot of an image and will overwrite primary slot
	  with it. In this mode it is not possible to revert back to previous version as it is not
	  stored in the secondary slot.
	  This mode supports MCUBOOT_BOOTLOADER_NO_DOWNGRADE which means that the overwrite will
	  not happen unless the version of secondary slot is higher than the version in primary
	  slot.

config MCUBOOT_MODE_DIRECT_XIP
	bool "DirectXIP"
	help
	  MCUboot expects slot0_partition and slot1_partition to exist in DT. In this mode MCUboot
	  can boot from either partition and will select one with higher application image version,
	  which usually means major.minor.patch triple, unless BOOT_VERSION_CMP_USE_BUILD_NUMBER is
	  also selected in MCUboot that enables comparison of build number.
	  This option automatically selects MCUBOOT_BOOTLOADER_NO_DOWNGRADE as it is not possible
	  to swap back to older version of application.

config MCUBOOT_MODE_DIRECT_XIP_WITH_REVERT
	bool "DirectXIP with revert"
	help
	  MCUboot expects slot0_partition and slot1_partition to exist in DT. In this mode MCUboot
	  will boot the application with the higher version from either slot, as long as it has
	  been marked to be boot next time for test or permanently. In case when application is
	  marked for test it needs to confirm itself, on the first boot, or it will be removed and
	  MCUboot will revert to booting previously approved application.
	  This mode does not allow freely switching between application versions, as, once higher
	  version application is approved, it is not possible to select lower version for boot.
	  This mode selects MCUBOOT_BOOTLOADER_NO_DOWNGRADE as it is not possible to downgrade
	  running application, but note that MCUboot may do that if application with higher
	  version will not get confirmed.

config MCUBOOT_MODE_RAM_LOAD
	bool "RAM load"
	help
	  MCUboot expects slot0_partition and slot1_partition to exist in DT. In this mode, MCUboot
	  will select the image with the higher version number, copy it to RAM and begin execution
	  from there. The image must be linked to execute from RAM, the address that it is copied
	  to is specified using the load-addr argument when running imgtool.

	  Note: RAM must be assigned to the bootloader that is not used by the application in this
	  mode so that the bootloader is able to function until the application has booted.

config MCUBOOT_MODE_RAM_LOAD_WITH_REVERT
	bool "RAM load with revert"
	help
	  MCUboot expects slot0_partition and slot1_partition to exist in DT. In this mode, MCUboot
	  will select the image with the higher version number, copy it to RAM and begin execution
	  from there. MCUBoot will only boot an image if it has been marked to be boot next time
	  for test or permanently. In case when application is marked for test it needs to confirm
	  itself, on the first boot, or it will be removed and MCUboot will revert to booting
	  previously approved application. The image must be linked to execute from RAM, the address
	  that it is copied to is specified using the load-addr argument when running imgtool.

	  Note: RAM must be assigned to the bootloader that is not used by the application in this
	  mode so that the bootloader is able to function until the application has booted.

config MCUBOOT_MODE_FIRMWARE_UPDATER
	bool "Firmware updater"
	help
	  MCUboot will only boot slot0_partition for the main application but has an entrance
	  mechanism defined for entering the slot1_partition which is a dedicated firmware updater
	  application used to update the slot0_partition application.

config MCUBOOT_MODE_SINGLE_APP_RAM_LOAD
	bool "Single app RAM load mode"
	help
	  MCUboot can load the image to RAM from an arbitrary location. In this mode,
	  MCUboot will copy the image to RAM and begin execution from there. The image
	  must be linked to execute from RAM, the address that it is copied to is
	  specified using the load-addr argument when running imgtool.
	  Note that while not used directly, a slot0_partition must be defined in the
	  DT, as it is used to get information about size of the image to be loaded.
	  This option automatically selects MCUBOOT_BOOTLOADER_NO_DOWNGRADE as it is
	  not possible to swap back to older version of the application. In fact, none
	  of the swap operations are supported in this mode.
