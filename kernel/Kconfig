config MULTITHREADING
	bool "Multi-threading" if ARCH_HAS_SINGLE_THREAD_SUPPORT
	default y
	help
	  If disabled, only the main thread is available, so a main() function
	  must be provided. Interrupts are available. Kernel objects will most
	  probably not behave as expected, especially with regards to pending,
	  since the main thread cannot pend, it being the only thread in the
	  system.

	  Many drivers and subsystems will not work with this option
	  set to 'n'; disable only when you REALLY know what you are
	  doing.

config NUM_COOP_PRIORITIES
	int "Number of coop priorities" if MULTITHREADING
	default 1 if !MULTITHREADING
	default 16
	range 0 128
	help
	  Number of cooperative priorities configured in the system. Gives access
	  to priorities:

		K_PRIO_COOP(0) to K_PRIO_COOP(CONFIG_NUM_COOP_PRIORITIES - 1)

	  or seen another way, priorities:

		-CONFIG_NUM_COOP_PRIORITIES to -1

	  This can be set to zero to disable cooperative scheduling. Cooperative
	  threads always preempt preemptible threads.

	  The total number of priorities is

	   NUM_COOP_PRIORITIES + NUM_PREEMPT_PRIORITIES + 1

	  The extra one is for the idle thread, which must run at the lowest
	  priority, and be the only thread at that priority.

config NUM_PREEMPT_PRIORITIES
	int "Number of preemptible priorities" if MULTITHREADING
	default 0 if !MULTITHREADING
	default 15
	range 0 128
	help
	  Number of preemptible priorities available in the system. Gives access
	  to priorities 0 to CONFIG_NUM_PREEMPT_PRIORITIES - 1.

	  This can be set to 0 to disable preemptible scheduling.

	  The total number of priorities is

	  priority, and be the only thread at that priority.

config MAIN_THREAD_PRIORITY
	int "Priority of initialization/main thread"
	default -2 if !PREEMPT_ENABLED
	default 0
	help
	  Priority at which the initialization thread runs, including the start
	  of the main() function. main() can then change its priority if desired.

config PREEMPT_ENABLED
	def_bool (NUM_PREEMPT_PRIORITIES != 0)

config PRIORITY_CEILING
	int "Priority inheritance ceiling"
	default -127
	help
	  This defines the minimum priority value (i.e. the logically
	  highest priority) that a thread will acquire as part of
	  k_mutex priority inheritance.

config NUM_METAIRQ_PRIORITIES
	int "Number of very-high priority 'preemptor' threads"
	default 0
	help
	  This defines a set of priorities at the (numerically) lowest
	  end of the range which have "meta-irq" behavior.  Runnable
	  threads at these priorities will always be scheduled before
	  threads at lower priorities, EVEN IF those threads are
	  otherwise cooperative and/or have taken a scheduler lock.
	  Making such a thread runnable in any way thus has the effect
	  of "interrupting" the current task and running the meta-irq
	  thread synchronously, like an exception or system call.  The
	  intent is to use these priorities to implement "interrupt
	  bottom half" or "tasklet" behavior, allowing driver
	  subsystems to return from interrupt context but be guaranteed
	  that user code will not be executed (on the current CPU)
	  until the remaining work is finished.  As this breaks the
	  "promise" of non-preemptibility granted by the current API
	  for cooperative threads, this tool probably shouldn't be used
	  from application code.

config SCHED_DEADLINE
	bool "Earliest-deadline-first scheduling"
	help
	  This enables a simple "earliest deadline first" scheduling
	  mode where threads can set "deadline" deltas measured in
	  k_cycle_get_32() units.  Priority decisions within (!!) a
	  single priority will choose the next expiring deadline and
	  not simply the least recently added thread.

config SCHED_CPU_MASK
	bool "CPU mask affinity/pinning API"
	depends on SCHED_DUMB
	help
	  When true, the application will have access to the
	  k_thread_cpu_mask_*() APIs which control per-CPU affinity masks in
	  SMP mode, allowing applications to pin threads to specific CPUs or
	  disallow threads from running on given CPUs.  Note that as currently
	  implemented, this involves an inherent O(N) scaling in the number of
	  idle-but-runnable threads, and thus works only with the DUMB
	  scheduler (as SCALABLE and MULTIQ would see no benefit).

	  Note that this setting does not technically depend on SMP and is
	  implemented without it for testing purposes, but for obvious reasons
	  makes sense as an application API only where there is more than one
	  CPU.  With one CPU, it's just a higher overhead version of
	  k_thread_start/stop().

config SCHED_CPU_MASK_PIN_ONLY
	bool "CPU mask variant with single-CPU pinning only"
	depends on SMP && SCHED_CPU_MASK
	help
	  When true, enables a variant of SCHED_CPU_MASK where only
	  one CPU may be specified for every thread.  Effectively, all
	  threads have a single "assigned" CPU and they will never be
	  scheduled symmetrically.  In general this is not helpful,
	  but some applications have a carefully designed threading
	  architecture and want to make their own decisions about how
	  to assign work to CPUs.  In that circumstance, some moderate
	  optimizations can be made (e.g. having a separate run queue
	  per CPU, keeping the list length shorter). When selected,
	  the CPU mask becomes an immutable thread attribute. It can
	  only be modified before a thread is started.  Most
	  applications don't want this.

config MAIN_STACK_SIZE
	int "Size of stack for initialization and main thread"
	default 2048 if COVERAGE_GCOV
	default 512 if ZTEST && !(RISCV || X86 || ARM || ARC || NIOS2)
	default 1024
	help
	  When the initialization is complete, the thread executing it then
	  executes the main() routine, so as to reuse the stack used by the
	  initialization, which would be wasted RAM otherwise.

	  After initialization is complete, the thread runs main().

config IDLE_STACK_SIZE
	int "Size of stack for idle thread"
	default 2048 if COVERAGE_GCOV
	default 1024 if XTENSA

	default 384 if DYNAMIC_OBJECTS
	default 320 if ARC || (ARM && CPU_HAS_FPU) || (X86 && MMU)
	default 256
	help
	  Depending on the work that the idle task must do, most likely due to
	  power management but possibly to other features like system event
	  logging (e.g. logging when the system goes to sleep), the idle thread
	  may need more stack space than the default value.

config ISR_STACK_SIZE
	int "ISR and initialization stack size (in bytes)"
	default 2048
	help
	  This option specifies the size of the stack used by interrupt

config THREAD_CUSTOM_DATA

choice SCHED_ALGORITHM
	prompt "Scheduler priority queue algorithm"
	default SCHED_DUMB
	help
	  The kernel can be built with several choices for the
	  ready queue implementation, offering different choices between
	  code size, constant factor runtime overhead and performance
	  scaling when many threads are added.

config SCHED_DUMB
	bool "Simple linked-list ready queue"
	help
	  When selected, the scheduler ready queue will be implemented
	  as a simple unordered list, with very fast constant time
	  performance for single threads and very low code size.
	  Choose this on systems with constrained code size that will
	  never see more than a small number (3, maybe) of runnable
	  threads in the queue at any given time.  On most platforms
	  (that are not otherwise using the red/black tree) this
	  results in a savings of ~2k of code size.

config SCHED_SCALABLE
	bool "Red/black tree ready queue"
	help
	  When selected, the scheduler ready queue will be implemented
	  as a red/black tree.  This has rather slower constant-time
	  insertion and removal overhead, and on most platforms (that
	  are not otherwise using the rbtree somewhere) requires an
	  extra ~2kb of code.  But the resulting behavior will scale
	  cleanly and quickly into the many thousands of threads.  Use
	  this on platforms where you may have many threads (very
	  roughly: more than 20 or so) marked as runnable at a given
	  time.  Most applications don't want this.

config SCHED_MULTIQ
	bool "Traditional multi-queue ready queue"
	depends on !SCHED_DEADLINE
	help
	  When selected, the scheduler ready queue will be implemented
	  as the classic/textbook array of lists, one per priority.
	  This corresponds to the scheduler algorithm used in Zephyr
	  versions prior to 1.12.  It incurs only a tiny code size
	  overhead vs. the "dumb" scheduler and runs in O(1) time
	  in almost all circumstances with very low constant factor.
	  But it requires a fairly large RAM budget to store those list
	  heads, and the limited features make it incompatible with
	  features like deadline scheduling that need to sort threads
	  more finely, and SMP affinity which need to traverse the list
	  of threads.  Typical applications with small numbers of runnable
	  threads probably want the DUMB scheduler.

endchoice # SCHED_ALGORITHM

choice WAITQ_ALGORITHM
	prompt "Wait queue priority algorithm"
	default WAITQ_DUMB
	help
	  The wait_q abstraction used in IPC primitives to pend
	  threads for later wakeup shares the same backend data
	  structure choices as the scheduler, and can use the same
	  options.

config WAITQ_SCALABLE
	bool "Use scalable wait_q implementation"
	help
	  When selected, the wait_q will be implemented with a
	  balanced tree.  Choose this if you expect to have many
	  threads waiting on individual primitives.  There is a ~2kb
	  code size increase over WAITQ_DUMB (which may be shared with
	  SCHED_SCALABLE) if the rbtree is not used elsewhere in the
	  application, and pend/unpend operations on "small" queues
	  will be somewhat slower (though this is not generally a
	  performance path).

config WAITQ_DUMB
	bool "Simple linked-list wait_q"
	help
	  When selected, the wait_q will be implemented with a
	  doubly-linked list.  Choose this if you expect to have only
	  a few threads blocked on any single IPC primitive.

	default y
	help
	  Enable per-thread errno in the kernel. Application and library code must
	  include errno.h provided by the C library (libc) to use the errno

	  before starting to print information on them during boot, as
	  some systems might boot to fast for a receiving endpoint to
	  detect the new USB serial bus, enumerate it and get ready to

	  For asynchronous timekeeping, the kernel defines a "ticks" concept. A
	  "tick" is the internal count in which the kernel does all its internal
	  uptime and timeout bookkeeping. Interrupts are expected to be delivered
	  on tick boundaries to the extent practical, and no fractional ticks
	  are tracked.

	  The choice of tick rate is configurable by this option. Also the number
	  of cycles per tick should be chosen so that 1 millisecond is exactly
	  represented by an integral number of ticks. Defaults on most hardware
	  platforms (ones that support setting arbitrary interrupt timeouts) are
	  expected to be in the range of 10 kHz, with software emulation
	  platforms and legacy drivers using a more traditional 100 Hz value.

	  Note that when available and enabled, in "tickless" mode
	  this config variable specifies the minimum available timing
	  granularity, not necessarily the number or frequency of
	  interrupts delivered to the kernel.

	  A value of 0 completely disables timer support in the kernel.

config SYS_CLOCK_HW_CYCLES_PER_SEC
	int "System clock's h/w timer frequency"
	help
	  This option specifies the frequency of the hardware timer used for the
	  system clock (in Hz). This option is set by the SOC's or board's Kconfig file
	  and the user should generally avoid modifying it via the menu configuration.

config SYS_CLOCK_EXISTS
	bool "System clock exists and is enabled"
	default y
	help
	  This option specifies that the kernel has timer support.

	  Some device configurations can eliminate significant code if
	  this is disabled.  Obviously timeout-related APIs will not
	  work when disabled.

config TIMEOUT_64BIT
	bool "Store kernel timeouts in 64 bit precision"
	default y
	help
	  When this option is true, the k_ticks_t values passed to
	  kernel APIs will be a 64 bit quantity, allowing the use of
	  larger values (and higher precision tick rates) without fear
	  of overflowing the 32 bit word.  This feature also gates the
	  availability of absolute timeout values (which require the
	  extra precision).

config SYS_CLOCK_MAX_TIMEOUT_DAYS
	int "Max timeout (in days) used in conversions"
	default 365
	help
	  Value is used in the time conversion static inline function to determine
	  at compile time which algorithm to use. One algorithm is faster, takes
	  less code but may overflow if multiplication of source and target
	  frequency exceeds 64 bits. Second algorithm prevents that. Faster
	  algorithm is selected for conversion if maximum timeout represented in
	  source frequency domain multiplied by target frequency fits in 64 bits.

config BUSYWAIT_CPU_LOOPS_PER_USEC
	int "Number of CPU loops per microsecond for crude busy looping"
	depends on !SYS_CLOCK_EXISTS && !ARCH_HAS_CUSTOM_BUSY_WAIT
	default 500
	help
	  Calibration for crude CPU based busy loop duration. The default
	  is assuming 1 GHz CPU and 2 cycles per loop. Reality is certainly
	  much worse but all we want here is a ball-park figure that ought
	  to be good enough for the purpose of being able to configure out
	  system timer support. If accuracy is very important then
	  implementing arch_busy_wait() should be considered.

config XIP
	bool "Execute in place"
	help
	  This option allows the kernel to operate with its text and read-only
	  sections residing in ROM (or similar read-only memory). Not all boards
	  support this option so it must be used with care; you must also
	  supply a linker command file when building your image. Enabling this
	  option increases both the code and data footprint of the image.

config STACK_CANARIES
	bool "Compiler stack canaries"
	depends on ENTROPY_GENERATOR || TEST_RANDOM_GENERATOR
	select NEED_LIBC_MEM_PARTITION if !STACK_CANARIES_TLS
	help
	  This option enables compiler stack canaries.

	  If stack canaries are supported by the compiler, it will emit
	  extra code that inserts a canary value into the stack frame when
	  a function is entered and validates this value upon exit.
	  Stack corruption (such as that caused by buffer overflow) results
	  in a fatal error condition for the running entity.
	  Enabling this option can result in a significant increase
	  in footprint and an associated decrease in performance.

	  If stack canaries are not supported by the compiler an error
	  will occur at build time.

config STACK_CANARIES_TLS
	bool "Stack canaries using thread local storage"
	depends on THREAD_LOCAL_STORAGE
	depends on ARCH_HAS_STACK_CANARIES_TLS
	help
	  This option enables compiler stack canaries on TLS.

	  Stack canaries will leave in the thread local storage and
	  each thread will have its own canary. This makes harder
	  to predict the canary location and value.

	  When enabled this causes an additional performance penalty
	  during thread creations because it needs a new random value
	  per thread.

	  and vice versa.  This might not be acceptable in all scenarios,
	  so this option is given for those unafraid of shooting themselves
	  in the foot.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config STACK_POINTER_RANDOM
	int "Initial stack pointer randomization bounds"
	depends on !STACK_GROWS_UP
	depends on MULTITHREADING
	depends on TEST_RANDOM_GENERATOR || ENTROPY_HAS_DRIVER
	default 0
	help
	  This option performs a limited form of Address Space Layout
	  Randomization by offsetting some random value to a thread's
	  initial stack pointer upon creation. This hinders some types of
	  security attacks by making the location of any given stack frame
	  non-deterministic.

	  This feature can waste up to the specified size in bytes the stack
	  region, which is carved out of the total size of the stack region.
	  A reasonable minimum value would be around 100 bytes if this can
	  be spared.

	  This is currently only implemented for systems whose stack pointers
	  grow towards lower memory addresses.

config BOUNDS_CHECK_BYPASS_MITIGATION
	bool "Bounds check bypass mitigations for speculative execution"
	depends on USERSPACE
	help
	  Untrusted parameters from user mode may be used in system calls to
	  index arrays during speculative execution, also known as the Spectre
	  V1 vulnerability. When enabled, various macros defined in
	  misc/speculation.h will insert fence instructions or other appropriate
	  mitigations after bounds checking any array index parameters passed
	  in from untrusted sources (user mode threads). When disabled, these
	  macros do nothing.
