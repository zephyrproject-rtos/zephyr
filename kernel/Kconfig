config MULTITHREADING
	bool
	prompt "Multi-threading"
	default y
	help
	  If disabled, only the main thread is available, so a main() function
	  must be provided. Interrupts are available. Kernel objects will most
	  probably not behave as expected, especially with regards to pending,
	  since the main thread cannot pend, it being the only thread in the
	  system.

	  Many drivers and subsystems will not work with this option; use only
	  when you REALLY know what you are doing.

config NUM_COOP_PRIORITIES
	int
	prompt "Number of coop priorities" if MULTITHREADING
	default 16
	default 1 if !MULTITHREADING
	range 0 128
	help
	  Number of cooperative priorities configured in the system. Gives access
	  to priorities:

		K_PRIO_COOP(0) to K_PRIO_COOP(CONFIG_NUM_COOP_PRIORITIES - 1)

	  or seen another way, priorities:

		-CONFIG_NUM_COOP_PRIORITIES to -1

	  This can be set to zero to disable cooperative scheduling. Cooperative
	  threads always preempt preemptible threads.

	  Each priority requires an extra 8 bytes of RAM. Each set of 32 extra
	  total priorities require an extra 4 bytes and add one possible
	  iteration to loops that search for the next thread to run.

	  The total number of priorities is

	   NUM_COOP_PRIORITIES + NUM_PREEMPT_PRIORITIES + 1

	  The extra one is for the idle thread, which must run at the lowest
	  priority, and be the only thread at that priority.

config NUM_PREEMPT_PRIORITIES
	int
	prompt "Number of preemptible priorities" if MULTITHREADING
	default 15
	default 0 if !MULTITHREADING
	range 0 128
	help
	  Number of preemptible priorities available in the system. Gives access
	  to priorities 0 to CONFIG_NUM_PREEMPT_PRIORITIES - 1.

	  This can be set to 0 to disable preemptible scheduling.

	  Each priority requires an extra 8 bytes of RAM. Each set of 32 extra
	  total priorities require an extra 4 bytes and add one possible
	  iteration to loops that search for the next thread to run.

	  The total number of priorities is

	   NUM_COOP_PRIORITIES + NUM_PREEMPT_PRIORITIES + 1

	  The extra one is for the idle thread, which must run at the lowest
	  priority, and be the only thread at that priority.

config MAIN_THREAD_PRIORITY
	int
	prompt "Priority of initialization/main thread"
	default 0
	default -2 if !PREEMPT_ENABLED
	help
	  Priority at which the initialization thread runs, including the start
	  of the main() function. main() can then change its priority if desired.

config COOP_ENABLED
	bool
	default y
	default n if (NUM_COOP_PRIORITIES = 0)

config PREEMPT_ENABLED
	bool
	default y
	default n if (NUM_PREEMPT_PRIORITIES = 0)

config PRIORITY_CEILING
	int
	prompt "Priority inheritance ceiling"
	default 0

config MAIN_STACK_SIZE
	int
	prompt "Size of stack for initialization and main thread"
	default 1024
	default 512 if ZTEST
	help
	  When the initialization is complete, the thread executing it then
	  executes the main() routine, so as to reuse the stack used by the
	  initialization, which would be wasted RAM otherwise.

	  After initialization is complete, the thread runs main().

config IDLE_STACK_SIZE
	int
	prompt "Size of stack for idle thread"
	default 256
	default 320 if ARC || (ARM && CPU_HAS_FPU)
	default 512 if RISCV32
	default 1024 if XTENSA
	help
	  Depending on the work that the idle task must do, most likely due to
	  power management but possibly to other features like system event
	  logging (e.g. logging when the system goes to sleep), the idle thread
	  may need more stack space than the default value.

config ISR_STACK_SIZE
	int
	prompt "ISR and initialization stack size (in bytes)"
	default 2048
	help
	  This option specifies the size of the stack used by interrupt
	  service routines (ISRs), and during kernel initialization.

config THREAD_STACK_INFO
	bool
	prompt "Thread stack info"
	default n
	help
	  This option allows each thread to store the thread stack info into
	  the k_thread data structure.

config  THREAD_CUSTOM_DATA
	bool
	prompt "Thread custom data"
	default n
	help
	  This option allows each thread to store 32 bits of custom data,
	  which can be accessed using the k_thread_custom_data_xxx() APIs.

config ERRNO
	bool
	prompt "Enable errno support"
	default y
	help
	  Enable per-thread errno in the kernel. Application and library code must
	  include errno.h provided by the C library (libc) to use the errno
	  symbol. The C library must access the per-thread errno via the
	  _get_errno() symbol.

config APPLICATION_MEMORY
	bool
	prompt "Split kernel and application memory"
	default n
	help
	  For all read-write memory sections (namely bss, noinit, data),
	  separate them into application and kernel areas. The application area
	  will have the project-level application objects and any libraries
	  including the C library in it.

menu "Kernel Debugging and Metrics"
config KERNEL_DEBUG
	bool
	prompt "Kernel debugging"
	default n
	select INIT_STACKS
	help
	  Enable kernel debugging.

	  Note that debugging the kernel internals can be very verbose.

config BOOT_BANNER
	bool
	prompt "Boot banner"
	default n
	depends on CONSOLE_HAS_DRIVER
	select PRINTK
	select EARLY_CONSOLE
	help
	  This option outputs a banner to the console device during boot up. It
	  also embeds a date & time stamp in the kernel if the BUILD_TIMESTAMP
	  option is enabled.

config BOOT_DELAY
	int
	prompt "Boot delay in milliseconds"
	default 0
	help
	  This option delays bootup for the specified amount of
	  milliseconds. This is used to allow serial ports to get ready
	  before starting to print information on them during boot, as
	  some systems might boot to fast for a receiving endpoint to
	  detect the new USB serial bus, enumerate it and get ready to
	  receive before it actually gets data. A similar effect can be
	  achieved by waiting for DCD on the serial port--however, not
	  all serial ports have DCD.

config BUILD_TIMESTAMP
	bool
	prompt "Build Timestamp"
	help
	  Build timestamp and add it to the boot banner.

config INT_LATENCY_BENCHMARK
	bool
	prompt "Interrupt latency metrics [EXPERIMENTAL]"
	default n
	depends on ARCH="x86"
	help
	  This option enables the tracking of interrupt latency metrics;
	  the exact set of metrics being tracked is board-dependent.
	  Tracking begins when int_latency_init() is invoked by an application.
	  The metrics are displayed (and a new sampling interval is started)
	  each time int_latency_show() is called thereafter.

config EXECUTION_BENCHMARKING
	bool
	prompt "Timing metrics "
	default n
	help
	  This option enables the tracking of various times inside the kernel
	  the exact set of metrics being tracked is board-dependent.
	  All timing measurements are enabled for X86 and ARM based architectures.
	  In other architectures only a subset are enabled.

config THREAD_MONITOR
	bool
	prompt "Thread monitoring [EXPERIMENTAL]"
	default n
	help
	  This option instructs the kernel to maintain a list of all threads
	  (excluding those that have not yet started or have already
	  terminated).

menu "Atomic Operations"
config ATOMIC_OPERATIONS_BUILTIN
	bool
	help
	  Use the compiler builtin functions for atomic operations. This is
	  the preferred method. However, support for all arches in GCC is
	  incomplete.

config ATOMIC_OPERATIONS_CUSTOM
	bool
	help
	  Use when there isn't support for compiler built-ins, but you have
	  written optimized assembly code under arch/ which implements these.

config ATOMIC_OPERATIONS_C
	bool
	help
	  Use atomic operations routines that are implemented entirely
	  in C by locking interrupts. Selected by architectures which either
	  do not have support for atomic operations in their instruction
	  set, or haven't been implemented yet during bring-up, and also
	  the compiler does not have support for the atomic __sync_* builtins.
endmenu

menu "Timer API Options"

config TIMESLICING
	bool "Thread time slicing"
	default y
	depends on SYS_CLOCK_EXISTS && (NUM_PREEMPT_PRIORITIES != 0)
	help
	  This option enables time slicing between preemptible threads of
	  equal priority.

config TIMESLICE_SIZE
	int "Time slice size (in ms)"
	default 0
	range 0 2147483647
	depends on TIMESLICING
	help
	  This option specifies the maximum amount of time a thread can execute
	  before other threads of equal priority are given an opportunity to run.
	  A time slice size of zero means "no limit" (i.e. an infinitely large
	  time slice).

config TIMESLICE_PRIORITY
	int "Time slicing thread priority ceiling"
	default 0
	range 0 NUM_PREEMPT_PRIORITIES
	depends on TIMESLICING
	help
	  This option specifies the thread priority level at which time slicing
	  takes effect; threads having a higher priority than this ceiling are
	  not subject to time slicing.

config POLL
	bool
	prompt "async I/O framework"
	default n
	help
	  Asynchronous notification framework. Enable the k_poll() and
	  k_poll_signal() APIs.  The former can wait on multiple events
	  concurrently, which can be either directly triggered or triggered by
	  the availability of some kernel objects (semaphores and fifos).

endmenu

menu "Other Kernel Object Options"

config NUM_MBOX_ASYNC_MSGS
	int "Maximum number of in-flight asynchronous mailbox messages"
	default 10
	help
	  This option specifies the total number of asynchronous mailbox
	  messages that can exist simultaneously, across all mailboxes
	  in the system.

	  Setting this option to 0 disables support for asynchronous
	  mailbox messages.

config NUM_PIPE_ASYNC_MSGS
	int "Maximum number of in-flight asynchronous pipe messages"
	default 10
	help
	  This option specifies the total number of asynchronous pipe
	  messages that can exist simultaneously, across all pipes in
	  the system.

	  Setting this option to 0 disables support for asynchronous
	  pipe messages.

endmenu

menu "Memory Pool Options"
config HEAP_MEM_POOL_SIZE
	int
	prompt "Heap memory pool size (in bytes)"
	default 0
	help
	  This option specifies the size of the heap memory pool used when
	  dynamically allocating memory using k_malloc(). Supported values
	  are: 256, 1024, 4096, and 16384. A size of zero means that no
	  heap memory pool is defined.
endmenu


config ARCH_HAS_CUSTOM_SWAP_TO_MAIN
	bool
	# hidden
	default n
	help
	  It's possible that an architecture port cannot use _Swap() to swap to
	  the _main() thread, but instead must do something custom. It must
	  enable this option in that case.

config SYS_CLOCK_TICKS_PER_SEC
	int
	prompt "System tick frequency (in ticks/second)"
	default 100
	help
	  This option specifies the frequency of the system clock in Hz.

	  Depending on the choice made, an amount of possibly expensive math must
	  occur when converting ticks to milliseconds and vice-versa. Some values
	  are optimized, and yield significantly less math.

	  The optimal values from a computational point-of-view are 1000, 500,
	  250 and 125, since in these cases there is either no computation
	  required, or it is all done via bit-shifting. These also give a
	  granularity from 1ms to 8ms.

	  Other good values are 100, 50, 25, 20 and 10. In this case, some math
	  is required but is minimized. These are also values that necessitate a
	  reduced number of clock interrupts per second, at the cost of
	  granularity (10ms to 100ms).

	  All other values require some extensive 64-bit math, and in some
	  configurations even require calls to compiler built-in functions, and
	  can require a non-trivial extra amount of stack space (e.g. around 80
	  bytes on x86).

config SYS_CLOCK_HW_CYCLES_PER_SEC
	int "System clock's h/w timer frequency"
	help
	  This option specifies the frequency of the hardware timer used for the
	  system clock (in Hz). This option is set by the board's Kconfig file
	  and the user should generally avoid modifying it via the menu configuration.

config SYS_CLOCK_EXISTS
	bool
	# omit prompt to signify a "hidden" option
	default y
	default n if (SYS_CLOCK_TICKS_PER_SEC = 0)
	help
	  This option specifies that the kernel lacks timer support.

config INIT_STACKS
	bool
	prompt "Initialize stack areas"
	default n
	help
	  This option instructs the kernel to initialize stack areas with a
	  known value (0xaa) before they are first used, so that the high
	  water mark can be easily determined. This applies to the stack areas
	  for threads.

config XIP
	bool
	prompt "Execute in place"
	help
	  This option allows the kernel to operate with its text and read-only
	  sections residing in ROM (or similar read-only memory). Not all boards
	  support this option so it must be used with care; you must also
	  supply a linker command file when building your image. Enabling this
	  option increases both the code and data footprint of the image.

config RING_BUFFER
	bool
	prompt "Enable ring buffers"
	default n
	help
	  Enable usage of ring buffers. This is similar to kernel FIFOs but ring
	  buffers manage their own buffer memory and can store arbitrary data.
	  For optimal performance, use buffer sizes that are a power of 2.

menu "Initialization Priorities"

config KERNEL_INIT_PRIORITY_OBJECTS
	int
	prompt "Kernel objects initialization priority"
	default 30
	help
	  Kernel objects use this priority for initialization. This
	  priority needs to be higher than minimal default initialization
	  priority.

config KERNEL_INIT_PRIORITY_DEFAULT
	int
	prompt "Default init priority"
	default 40
	help
	  Default minimal init priority for each init level.

config KERNEL_INIT_PRIORITY_DEVICE
	int
	prompt "Default init priority for device drivers"
	default 50
	help
	  Device driver, that depends on common components, such as
	  interrupt controller, but does not depend on other devices,
	  uses this init priority.

config APPLICATION_INIT_PRIORITY
	int
	prompt "Default init priority for application level drivers"
	default 90
	help
	  This priority level is for end-user drivers such as sensors and display
	  which have no inward dependencies.

config PTHREAD_IPC
	bool
	prompt "POSIX pthread IPC API"
	default n
	help
        This enables a mostly-standards-compliant implementation of
        the pthread mutex, condition variable and barrier IPC
        mechanisms.
endmenu

menu "Security Options"

config STACK_CANARIES
	bool
	prompt "Compiler stack canaries"
	default n
	help
	  This option enables compiler stack canaries support kernel functions.

	  If stack canaries are supported by the compiler, it will emit
	  extra code that inserts a canary value into the stack frame when
	  a function is entered and validates this value upon exit.
	  Stack corruption (such as that caused by buffer overflow) results
	  in a fatal error condition for the running entity.
	  Enabling this option can result in a significant increase
	  in footprint and an associated decrease in performance.

	  If stack canaries are not supported by the compiler, enabling this
	  option has no effect.

config EXECUTE_XOR_WRITE
	bool "Enable W^X for memory partitions"
	depends on USERSPACE
	depends on ARCH_HAS_EXECUTABLE_PAGE_BIT
	default y
	help
	  When enabled, will enforce that a writable page isn't executable
	  and vice versa.  This might not be acceptable in all scenarios,
	  so this option is given for those unafraid of shooting themselves
	  in the foot.

	  If unsure, say Y.
