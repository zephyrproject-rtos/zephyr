/** Cooperative context switch primitive
 *
 * The action of arch_switch() should be to switch to a new context
 * passed in the first argument, and save a pointer to the current
 * context into the address passed in the second argument.
 *
 * The actual type and interpretation of the switch handle is specified
 * by the architecture.  It is the same data structure stored in the
 * "switch_handle" field of a newly-created thread in arch_new_thread(),
 * and passed to the kernel as the "interrupted" argument to
 * z_get_next_switch_handle().
 *
 * Note that on SMP systems, the kernel uses the store through the
 * second pointer as a synchronization point to detect when a thread
 * context is completely saved (so another CPU can know when it is
 * safe to switch).  This store must be done AFTER all relevant state
 * is saved, and must include whatever memory barriers or cache
 * management code is required to be sure another CPU will see the
 * result correctly.
 *
 * The simplest implementation of arch_switch() is generally to push
 * state onto the thread stack and use the resulting stack pointer as the
 * switch handle.  Some architectures may instead decide to use a pointer
 * into the thread struct as the "switch handle" type.  These can legally
 * assume that the second argument to arch_switch() is the address of the
 * switch_handle field of struct thread_base and can use an offset on
 * this value to find other parts of the thread struct.  For example a (C
 * pseudocode) implementation of arch_switch() might look like:
 *
 *   void arch_switch(void *switch_to, void **switched_from)
 *   {
 *       struct k_thread *new = switch_to;
 *       struct k_thread *old = CONTAINER_OF(switched_from, struct k_thread,
 *                                           switch_handle);
 *
 *       // save old context...
 *       *switched_from = old;
 *       // restore new context...
 *   }
 *
 * Note that the kernel manages the switch_handle field for
 * synchronization as described above.  So it is not legal for
 * architecture code to assume that it has any particular value at any
 * other time.  In particular it is not legal to read the field from the
 * address passed in the second argument.
 *
 * @param switch_to Incoming thread's switch handle
 * @param switched_from Pointer to outgoing thread's switch handle storage
 *        location, which must be updated.
