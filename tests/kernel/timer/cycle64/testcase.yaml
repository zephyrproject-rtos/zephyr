# Note: Re: slow vs fast
#
# Some platforms such as native_sim, qemu_riscv32, qemu_riscv64
# complete these tests almost instantaneously because of qemu timer
# quirks ("time warp") even though the test reports that it completes
# in e.g. 14 s. We can take advantage of that for fast tests on each PR
# but we also want to exercise this code path during daily builds or
# otherwise when users specify "twister --enable-slow".
#
# As other platforms are added with varying timer frequencies, increase
# timeout as necessary.
