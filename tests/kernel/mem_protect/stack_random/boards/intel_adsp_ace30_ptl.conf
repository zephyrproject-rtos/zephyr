# Due to CONFIG_DCACHE_LINE_SIZE=64, the stack is always aligned on 64 bytes.
# With data cache line size and CONFIG_STACK_POINTER_RANDOM=64, there is not
# much randomness as any added offset (<= 64) would be rounded up to 64 bytes
# due to stack alignment. So make CONFIG_STACK_POINTER_RANDOM larger such
# that the added offset to stack pointer will actually have an effect.
