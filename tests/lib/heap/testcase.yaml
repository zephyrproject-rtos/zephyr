# Excludes m2gl025_miv, which is based on the renode simulator.  This
# is very slow for CPU-bound tests like this, taking upwards of 10
# minutes (vs. ~20 seconds for qemu) to complete in CI.  There's
# little value there, this is a unit test of library code and we have
# coverage of the RISC-V architectures via qemu platforms already.
# Excludes qemu_xtensa due to pathological runtimes which cannot be
# reproduced on real hardware.
