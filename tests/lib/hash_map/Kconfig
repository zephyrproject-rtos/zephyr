config TEST_LIB_HASH_MAP_MAX_ENTRIES
	int "Maximum number of Hashmap entries"
	default 40
	help
	  When benchmarking the performance of the Hashmap, it helps to be able
	  to vary the number of entries to insert or remove from the hash table
	  in a convenient way. This option translates to MANY in the test sources.

	  CONFIG_TEST_LIB_HASH_MAP_MAX_ENTRIES

	  Of course, using realloc(), we are limited by the amount of available
	  heap memory. For test scenarios using the Minimal C library, the heap
	  size is controlled via

	  CONFIG_COMMON_LIBC_MALLOC_ARENA_SIZE

	  For native_sim, the number of entries can be configured
	  independently of the arena size since the native libc is used.
