config TEST_NUM_CPUS
	int "Number of CPUs to use in parallel"
	range 1 MP_NUM_CPUS
	default MP_NUM_CPUS
	help
	  The number of parallel threads to run during the test. The test
	  thread itself yields so that all cores have some probability of
	  causing racey behaviour.

config TEST_DURATION_S
	int "Number of seconds to run the test"
	range 1 21600
	default 10
	help
	   Duration for the test, in seconds. The range has a reblatively high
	   upper bound because we should expect that pthread_create() and
	   pthread_join() are stable enough to run for an arbitrarily long
	   period of time without encountering any race conditions.

config TEST_DELAY_US
	int "Microseconds to delay between pthread join and create"
	default 0
	help
	  If there is a race condition, a value of zero here should
	  cause a crash.

config TEST_STACK_SIZE
	int "Size of each thread stack in this test"
	default 2048 if !64_BIT
	default 4096 if 64_BIT
	help
	  The minimal stack size required to run a no-op thread.

config TEST_KTHREADS
	bool "Test k_threads"
	default y
	help
	  Run tests for k_threads

config TEST_PTHREADS
	bool "Test pthreads"
	default n
	help
	  Run tests for pthreads
