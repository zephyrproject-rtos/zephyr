config GENERIC_SENSOR_TEST
	bool "Compile and run the generic sensor tests"
	depends on ZTEST
	help
	  Enables building and running the generic sensor test suite that will
	  iterate through the device tree and run sample path tests on any
	  sensor that supports the backend sensor emulator API.

config GENERIC_SENSOR_TEST_NUM_EXPECTED_VALS
	int "Number of expected values to use in test"
	default 5
	depends on GENERIC_SENSOR_TEST
	help
	  Controls the number of expected values to use in the generic sensor
	  test, interpolated from the sensor's reported lower and upper sample
	  range boundaries. The test will run one iteration for each expected
	  value. For example, if GENERIC_TEST_NUM_EXPECTED_VALS == 5, and the
	  sensor range is 0..100, the test will run 5 times with expected values
	  0, 25, 50, 75, and 100. These iterations are run in parallel.
