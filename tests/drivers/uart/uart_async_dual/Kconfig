	  For how many loops will the stress test run. The higher this number the longer the
	  test and therefore the higher likelihood an unlikely race/event will be triggered.

	  When enabled then test cases that transmits TX packets in random chunks are
	  performed. Some driver implementation do not support case when new TX data
	  collides with handling of the RX timeout.
