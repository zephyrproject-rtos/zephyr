    tests/drivers/pwm/pwm_to_gpio_loopback test in Zephyr.

compatible: "test-pwm-to-gpio-loopback"

properties:
  pwms:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true

      PWM pin that will be used for generating a pulse-width modulated signal.
  gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      GPIO pin will be used for capturing the generated signal. The PWM and GPIO
      pins must be physically connected to each other.
