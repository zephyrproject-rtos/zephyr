config SAMPLING_TIME
	int "Sampling wait time (ms)"
	default 50
	help
	  Time to wait for PWM edge sampling, in milliseconds.

config SKIP_EDGE_NUM
	int "Number of edges to skip before sampling PWM"
	default 2
	help
	  Number of PWM edges to skip before starting sampling.
	  This parameter improves measurement precision as there can be significant
	  latency in the first sampled edge.

config ALLOWED_DEVIATION
	int "Allowed deviation (%) for PWM timing checks"
	default 5
	range 0 100
	help
	  Maximum allowed deviation (%) from the programmed values for the test to be
	  considered a PASS. For example, if set to 5, the measured period or duty cycle
	  can deviate by up to 5% from the programmed values for the test to pass.
