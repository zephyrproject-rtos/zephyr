    This binding provides resources required to build and run the
    tests/drivers/watchdog/wdt_error_cases test in Zephyr.

compatible: "test-wdt-error-cases"

properties:
  opt-pause-in-sleep:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If true, the watchdog timer will be paused when the CPU is in sleep mode.
      This is useful to prevent the watchdog from triggering during low-power
      states.
  opt-pause-halted-by-dbg:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If true, the watchdog timer will be paused when the CPU is halted by a
      debugger. This allows the watchdog to be used during debugging without
      triggering a reset.
  feed-can-stall:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If true, feeding the watchdog can stall the CPU. This is useful for
      testing purposes to simulate a watchdog timeout.
  window-min:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If true, the watchdog supports a minimum window value. This allows for
      more precise control over the watchdog timeout period.
  opt-pause-in-sleep-requires-pm:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If true, the watchdog timer can only be paused in sleep mode if
      power management is enabled.
  flag-reset-cpu-core:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If true, the watchdog supports resetting the CPU core. This allows for
      more flexible error recovery options.
  flag-reset-none:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If true, the watchdog supports not resetting the CPU core. This allows for
      more flexible error recovery options.
