  Binding for emulated clock consumer device. This device is used in testing
  to verify that clock states are applied as expected.

compatible: "vnd,emul-clock-consumer"

include: [clock-device.yaml]

properties:
  fast-default-freq:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Frequency this consumer expects to read when applying default
      clock state for fast output

  fast-sleep-freq:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Frequency this consumer expects to read when applying sleep
      clock state for fast output

  fast-request-freq:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Frequency this consumer will request from the fast output. Consumer
      expects the resulting frequency from this request to match the
      requested frequency exactly.

  slow-default-freq:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Frequency this consumer expects to read when applying default
      clock state for slow output

  slow-sleep-freq:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Frequency this consumer expects to read when applying sleep
      clock state for slow output

  slow-request-freq:

      Frequency this consumer will request from the slow output. Consumer
      expects the resulting frequency from this request to match the
