          Identity of a GPIO that is shorted to the GPIO identified in the
          test regulator enable-gpios property.  This is used to confirm that
          signal's state.

          The active level in the flags cell of this must match the
          active level of the flags cell in the regulator's enable-gpios
          property, and the flags must include a PULL to the inactive
          level.
