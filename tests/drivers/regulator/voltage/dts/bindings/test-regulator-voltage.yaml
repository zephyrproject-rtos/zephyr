    This binding provides resources required to build and run the
    tests/drivers/regulator/voltage test in Zephyr.

compatible: "test-regulator-voltage"

properties:
  regulators:
    type: phandles
    required: true
    description: |
      Regulators to be tested. Each entry must have a matching ADC entry in
      io-channels.

  io-channels:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      ADC channels to be used. Each entry must have a matching entry in
      regulators.

  tolerance-microvolt:
    type: array
    required: true
    description: |
      Tolerance (+/-) when reading configured voltages using ADC. This should
      be set at most to the regulator resolution. Some noisy regulators may
      require more, though. Each entry must have a matching entry in
      regulators.

  adc-avg-count:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      Number of ADC readings to average. Defaults to 1 (no average).

  set-read-delay-ms:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Delay between voltage set and ADC read. Defaults to 0 (no delay).

  min-microvolt:
    type: int
    default: -2147483648
    description: |
      Specifies the minimum voltage at which the test will run, in microvolts.
      Used to filter out ranges that cannot be tested correctly in the configuration.

  max-microvolt:
    type: int
    default: 2147483647
    description: |
      Specifies the maximum voltage at which the test will run, in microvolts.
      Used to filter out ranges that cannot be tested correctly in the configuration.
