# CONFIG_DMA_TCD_QUEUE_SIZE sets size of queue used to chain DMA blocks (TCDs)
# together, and should be sized as needed by the application.  If not large
# enough, the DMA may starve.  Symptoms of this issue include transmit blocks
# repeated, or RX blocks skipped. For I2S driver, queue size must be at least 3.
