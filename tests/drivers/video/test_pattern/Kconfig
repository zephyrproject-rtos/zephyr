config TEST_PIXEL_FORMAT
	string "Pixel format of the video frame"
	help
	  Pixel format of the video frame. If not set, the default pixel format is used.

config TEST_FRAME_HEIGHT
	int "Height of the video frame"
	default 0
	help
	  Height of the video frame. If set to 0, the default height is used.

config TEST_FRAME_WIDTH
	int "Width of the video frame"
	default 0
	help
	  Width of the video frame. If set to 0, the default width is used.

config TEST_FRAMES_TOTAL
	int "Number of frames to test in total"
	default 1000
	help
	  Video hardware do not always produce valid frames immediately, at high FPS, there can
	  be a lot of frames completely black or otherwise invalid before the test pattern
	  to show-up, which would still be the expected behavior of the hardware.

config TEST_PATTERN_CTRL
	int "Value used for the test pattern menu control"
	default 1
	help
	  Some drivers support different types of test patterns and/or in a different order.
	  Control the menu CID value to select the correct "vertical color bar" pattern.

config TEST_FRAMES_VALID
	int "Number of valid frames to expect"
	default 10
	help
	  Number of frames after which consider the test successful.
	  A valid frame is a frame featuring the test pattern with colors close enough according
	  to CONFIG_TEST_LAB_THRESHOLD.

config TEST_LAB_THRESHOLD
	int "CIE LAB acceptance threshold"
	default 10
	help
	  Margin value to consider the color similarity to be close enough.
	  The default is 10 to allow slight difference to be ignored, and complete swaps to
	  always be detected. This can be raised in case the colors are all slightly off but
	  correctly ordered.
