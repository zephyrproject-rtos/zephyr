/**
 * NOTE: For this test, a _configurable_ EXTI line that doesn't conflict
 * with other users should be specified, along with the associated IRQn.
 *
 * On most STM32 series so far, EXTI line 16 is configurable, generates an
 * interrupt on IRQn 1, and corresponds to events raised by the PVD. Since
 * the PVD is not available in Zephyr yet, there is no risk of conflict.
 *
 * This overlay will be used by default and configures EXTI line 16 with
 * IRQn 1 for use by the test, which should work on most hardware. Series
 * where this does not apply can define their own overlay to override it.
