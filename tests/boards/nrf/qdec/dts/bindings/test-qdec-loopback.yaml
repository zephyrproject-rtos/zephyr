  description: |
    Binding describing a single loopback pair consisting of a QDEC device and two "gpio-leds" pins
    working as a quadrature encoder for the test.
  properties:
    qdec:
      type: phandle
      required: true
      description: Node of the QDEC device used to capture quadrature signal in the loopback.
    qenc-emul-gpios:
      type: phandles
      required: true
      description: |
        Children nodes of "gpio-leds" compatible used to generate quadrature signal. The first
        phandles outputs phase A signal, the second one outputs phase B signal.
