# Written chunks have 0xFF padding on start and end to assure word alignment with flash.
# Start padding can overlap data of previous chunk; flash drivers can only pull bits down to 0,
# so overwriting with 0xFF is not possible. This config allows to "write" start padding 0xFF over
# previously witten data, which is considered overwrite although it takes no effect.
