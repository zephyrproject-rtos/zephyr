# The GICv3 & ITS drivers allocation needs are:
# - LPI prop table: global 1x64K aligned on 64K
# - LPI pend table: for each redistributor/cpu 1x64K aligned on 64K
# - Devices table: 128x4K aligned on 4K
# - Interrupt Collections table: 1x4K aligned on 4K
#
# This makes 11x64K to permit all allocations to success.
#
# Note, will need 64K HEAP_MEM per CPUs added.
#
# This doesn't necessarily include the Interrupt Translation Table, which are
# 256bytes aligned tables, for reference a 32 ITEs table needs 256bytes.
#
# To permit allocating 256 ITT tables of 32 ITEs, 13x64K HEAP_MEM is needed
