# The goal here is to showcase that Mbed TLS's PSA crypto implementation can be
# supported on any platform. A very minimal configuration is tested here: simply
# enable support for PSA crypto APIs in Mbed TLS and then test them with:
# - psa_crypto_init() which is required before any PSA crypto operation
# - psa_generate_random() which is always available as long as PSA crypto is
#   initialized.
#
# Since it might take too long to execute this test on all platforms
# supported by Zephyr, we reduce to a very small selected group whose
# characteristics are:
# - no TF-M enabled devices because we assume that the TF-M implementation
#   of PSA crypto is working fine on the platforms that support TF-M.
# - platform should be testable by the CI.
# - pick 1 platform which supports entropy driver and 1 which does not. The
#   latter case will allow to test
#   CONFIG_MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_EXTERNAL_RNG_ALLOW_NON_CSPRNG.
