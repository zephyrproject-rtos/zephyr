choice TM_TEST
	prompt "Select a Thread-Metric test to execute"
	default TM_PREEMPTIVE
	help
	  The Thread-Metric benchmark suite consists of eight RTOS tests.
	  These tests measure the total number of RTOS events that can be
	  processed during a 30 second time interval.

config TM_BASIC
	bool "Baseline basic benchmark"
	help
	  The baseline basic benchmark consists of a single thread that counts
	  the number of times it performs a set of calculations. This number
	  is reported every 30 seconds.

config TM_COOPERATIVE
	bool "Cooperative context switching"
	help
	  The cooperative context switching benchmark spawns five (5) threads
	  of equal priority that yield to each other and increment counters
	  on each context switch. The sum total of the counters is reported
	  every 30 seconds.

config TM_INTERRUPT
	bool "Interrupt processing"
	select TEST
	select IRQ_OFFLOAD
	select IRQ_OFFLOAD_NESTED
	help
	  The interrupt processing benchmark has a single thread that causes
	  an interrupt which results in its ISR incrementing a counter and then
	  posting a semaphore. The thread then increments its own counter and
	  takes that semaphore. The sum total of the counters is reported
	  every 30 seconds.

config TM_INTERRUPT_PREEMPTION
	bool "Interrupt processing preemption"
	select TEST
	select IRQ_OFFLOAD
	select IRQ_OFFLOAD_NESTED
	help
	  The interrupt preemption benchmark counts the number of times that
	  an ISR from a software generated interrupt results in the preemption
	  of a thread. The total number of context switches is reported every
	  30 seconds.

config TM_MEMORY_ALLOCATION
	bool "Memory allocation"
	help
	  The memory allocation benchmark counts the number of times a thread
	  is able to allocate and then release a 128-byte block. This number
	  is reported every 30 seconds.

config TM_MESSAGE
	bool "Message processing"
	help
	  The message processing benchmark counts the number of times that a
	  thread can send and receive a 16-byte message from a message queue.
	  This number is reported every 30 seconds.

config TM_PREEMPTIVE
	bool "Preemptive context switching"
	help
	  The preemptive context switching benchmark creates five (5) threads
	  of different priorities that suspend and resume each other in a
	  cyclical pattern. The total number of context switches is reported
	  every 30 seconds.

config TM_SYNCHRONIZATION
	bool "Synchronization"
	help
	  The synchronization benchmark counts the number of times that a
	  thread can give and take a semaphore without blocking. This number
	  is reported every 30 seconds.
