	  Test flash_area_open for returning -ENOENT for disabled partitions.
	  Note that custom flash maps may not support disabled partitions
	  and therefore not even generated id for them. In such case it would
	  not be possible to provide disabled partition id to flash_area_open,
	  making this test impossible to run.

	default y if !FLASH_MAP_CUSTOM
	help
	  Custom flash map may be defined outside of DTS definition, therefore
	  not have a DTS nodes for partitions.
