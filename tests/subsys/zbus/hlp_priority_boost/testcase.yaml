      # All Intel Audio DSP platforms have non-coherent cache
      # between CPUs. So the zbus_channel struct data goes
      # out-of-sync between CPUs with multiple producer and
      # consumer threads running concurrently on multiple CPUs,
      # resulting in bad pointer being used, e.g. passed to
      # memcpy(). So exclude these platforms from running in
      # twister as they are certain to fail.
