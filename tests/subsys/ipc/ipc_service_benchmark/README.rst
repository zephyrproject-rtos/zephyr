.. zephyr:code-sample:: ipc-icmsg
   :name: IPC service: icmsg backend
   :relevant-api: ipc

   Send messages between two cores using the IPC service and icmsg backend.

Overview
********

This application demonstrates how to use IPC Service and the icmsg backend with
Zephyr. It is designed to demonstrate how to integrate it with Zephyr both
from a build perspective and code.

Building the application for nrf5340dk/nrf5340/cpuapp

   :zephyr-app: samples/subsys/ipc/ipc_service/icmsg
   :board: nrf5340dk/nrf5340/cpuapp
   :goals: debug
   :west-args: --sysbuild

Open a serial terminal (minicom, putty, etc.) and connect the board with the
following settings:

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1

Reset the board and the following message will appear on the corresponding
serial port, one is host another is remote:
