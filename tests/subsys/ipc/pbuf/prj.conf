# pbuf is designed to run writer and reader code on two CPUs.
# The write function cannot be preempted by the read function in a CPU,
# or the cache management could result in data corruption.
# In the tests, the reader and the writer are executed on a single CPU.
# Disable data cache management to prevent potential data corruption.
