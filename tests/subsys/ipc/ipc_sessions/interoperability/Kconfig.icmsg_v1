	default y
	help
	  Provide synchronization access to shared memory at a library level.
	  This option is enabled by default to allow to use sending API from
	  multiple contexts. Mutex is used to guard access to the memory.
	  This option can be safely disabled if an application ensures data
	  are sent from single context.

	help
	  Maximum time to wait, in milliseconds, for access to send data with
	  backends basing on icmsg library. This time should be relatively low.

	  Time to wait for remote bonding notification before the

config IPC_SERVICE_BACKEND_ICMSG_WQ_ENABLE_V1
	bool "Use dedicated workqueue"
	depends on MULTITHREADING
	default y
	help
	  Enable dedicated workqueue thread for the ICMsg backend.
	  Disabling this configuration will cause the ICMsg backend to
	  process incoming data through the system workqueue context, and
	  therefore reduces the RAM footprint of the backend.
	  Disabling this config may result in deadlocks in certain usage
	  scenarios, such as when synchronous IPC is executed from the system
	  workqueue context.
	  The callbacks coming from the backend are executed from the workqueue
	  context.
	  When the option is disabled, the user must obey the restrictions
	  imposed by the system workqueue, such as never performing blocking
	  operations from within the callback.
