config TEST_HW_FLOW_CONTROL
	bool "Test hardware flow control"
	help
	  By default, the test uses backend transmit and receive
	  buffers of adequate size, and waits until transmitted
	  data has been fully received before next transmit.

	  This option limits the backend receive buffer size and
	  imposes a delay on reading received data, ensuring
	  transmitted data will be dropped if hw flow control is
	  not enabled.
