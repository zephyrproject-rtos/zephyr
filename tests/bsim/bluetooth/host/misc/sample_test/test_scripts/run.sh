# Use a unique simulation id per test script. It is a necessity as the CI runner
# will run all the test scripts in parallel. If multiple simulations share the
# same ID, they will step on each other's toes in unpredictable ways.
simulation_id=${test_name}

# This controls the verbosity of the simulator. It goes up to 9 (not 11, sorry)
# and is useful for figuring out what is happening on the PHYsical layer (e.g.
# device 1 starts listening at T=100us) among other things.
# `2` is the default value if not specified.

# This sets the watchdog timeout for the `Execute` function.
#
# Although all simulations are started with a bounded end (the `sim_length`
# option), something very wrong can still happen and this additional time-out
# will ensure all executables started by the current script are killed.
#
# It measures wall-clock time, not simulated time. E.g. a test that simulates 5
# hours might actually complete (have a runtime of) 10 seconds.
#
# The default is set in `sh_common.source`.
# Guidelines to set this value:
# - Do not set it to a value lower or equal to the default.
# - If the test takes over 5 seconds of runtime, set `EXECUTE_TIMEOUT` to at
#   least 5 times the run-time on your machine.
EXECUTE_TIMEOUT=120

# Set simulation length, in microseconds. The PHY will run for this amount of
# simulated time, unless both devices exit.
#
# If you are not early-exiting the devices (e.g. using `TEST_PASS_AND_EXIT()`),
# please run the test once and set the simulation time in the same ballpark. No
# need to simulate hours of runtime if the test finishes in 10 seconds.

SIM_LEN_US=$((2 * 1000 * 1000))

# This is the final path of the test executable.

# Some tests may have different executable images for each device in the test.

# In our case, both test cases are compiled in the same image, and the right one
# will be run depending on what arguments we give the executable.
