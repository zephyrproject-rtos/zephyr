# Test scenario:
# Initialize the mesh stack, but do not provision the device.
# Start the provisioning procedure using bt_mesh_prov_enable(BT_MESH_PROV_GATT).
# With a separate scanner device, observe PB-GATT beacons being sent
# at approximately 100ms intervals.
# Provision the device using bt_mesh_provision().
# With a separate scanner device, observe GATT Proxy beacons being sent
# at approximately 1s intervals.
# Allocate an advertiser buffer using bt_mesh_adv_buf_create().
# With the separate scanner, observe that the GATT Proxy beacons are not interrupted.
# Set the allocated buffer's xmit parameters to BT_MESH_TRANSMIT(5, 20).
# Submit the advertiser buffer using bt_mesh_adv_send().
# With the separate scanner, observe that the submitted buffer is transmitted
# at least 6 times. Then, observe GATT Proxy beacons resuming.
