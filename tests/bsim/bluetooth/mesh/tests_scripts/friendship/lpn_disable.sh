# Check that disabling LPN gives correct behaviour.
#
# In this test the lpn node will enable the lpn feature, and then immediately
# disables it again. Then we check that the lpn node is actually in a
# disabled state. This test ensures that a lpn disable call is not overwritten
# by a subsequent lpn enable call, since the enable call is associated with
# internal callback structures that might produce incorrect internal state
# of the LPN module
