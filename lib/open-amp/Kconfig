	  add the resource table in the generated binary. This table is
	  compatible with linux remote proc framework and OpenAMP library.

config OPENAMP_VENDOR_RSC_TABLE
	bool "Vendor specific resource table"
	depends on OPENAMP_RSC_TABLE
	help
	  Enable vendor-specific resource table with features
	  supported by remote processor.

	int "Resource table number of rpmsg buffers"
	default 0
	depends on OPENAMP_RSC_TABLE
	help
	  This option specifies the number of buffer used in a Vring for
	  interprocessor communication

config OPENAMP_RSC_TABLE_IPM_RX_ID
	int "IPM RX channel ID"
	default 0
	depends on OPENAMP_RSC_TABLE
	help
	   This option specifies the IPM RX channel ID used in a VRING
	   for interprocessor communication

config OPENAMP_COPY_RSC_TABLE
	bool "Copy resource table section"
	depends on OPENAMP_RSC_TABLE
	help
	  The .resource_table section must be placed in a specific location
	  known by both this core and the remote core. If this is not taken
	  care of by the remote then this firmware has the ability to copy
	  the table to a specific location. This memory region can be declared
	  in the device tree by the "zephyr,ipc_rsc_table" node.

	  This is not needed if the remote loads this firmware and has control
	  over the placement of the .resource_table section such as remoteproc.
