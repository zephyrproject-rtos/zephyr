	  interprocessor communication

config OPENAMP_COPY_RSC_TABLE
	bool "Copy resource table section"
	help
	  The .resource_table section must be placed in a specific location
	  known by both this core and the remote core. If this is not taken
	  care of by the remote then this firmware has the ability to copy
	  the table to a specific location. This memory region can be declared
	  in the device tree by the "zephyr,ipc_rsc_table" node.

	  This is not needed if the remote loads this firmware and has control
	  over the placement of the .resource_table section such as remoteproc.
