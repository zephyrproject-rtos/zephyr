	  This option instructs the Zephyr kernel to call the 'int main(void)'
	  instead of the 'void main(void)', which is the default main() type
	  for Zephyr.

	  C++ does not allow the main() to be defined with 'void' return type,
	  and any applications defining its main() in a C++ source file must
	  enable this option.
