	  The version number of C++ standard being used (NOTE: this uses the
	  full year and month, and is the same as the __cplusplus macro defined
	  by the compiler). This config can be used to check for a minimum
	  supported version. Example:

	    depends on STD_CPP_VERSION >= 201703

	  Adding this to your library's enablement Kconfig will force a minimum
	  c++17 standard.

	  The full year is used so c++98 can be checked using > and < operators
	  without conflicting with c++11 or higher.
