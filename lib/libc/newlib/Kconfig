	bool "Build with newlib-nano C library"

	help
	  Build with newlib-nano library, for small embedded apps.
	  The newlib-nano library for ARM embedded processors is a part of the
	  GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors.

config NEWLIB_LIBC_MAX_MAPPED_REGION_SIZE
	int "Maximum memory mapped for newlib heap"
	depends on MMU
	default 1048576
	help
	  On MMU-based systems, indicates the maximum amount of memory which
	  will be used for the newlib malloc() heap. The actual amount of
	  memory used will be the minimum of this value and the amount of
	  free physical memory at kernel boot.

config NEWLIB_LIBC_MIN_REQUIRED_HEAP_SIZE
	int "Newlib minimum required heap size"
	default 2048 if NEWLIB_LIBC_NANO
	default 8192 if !NEWLIB_LIBC_NANO
	help
	  Specifies the amount of memory space that must be available for the
	  newlib heap. An assertion failure message will be displayed during
	  initialization if the memory space available for the newlib heap is
	  smaller than this value.

config NEWLIB_LIBC_ALIGNED_HEAP_SIZE
	int "Newlib aligned heap size"
	depends on MPU_REQUIRES_POWER_OF_TWO_ALIGNMENT
	depends on USERSPACE
	default 0
	help
	  If user mode is enabled, and MPU hardware has requirements that
	  regions be sized to a power of two and aligned to their size,
	  and user mode threads need to access this heap, then this is necessary
	  to properly define an MPU region for the heap.

	  If this is left at 0, then remaining system RAM will be used for this
	  area and it may not be possible to program it as an MPU region.

config NEWLIB_LIBC_FLOAT_PRINTF
	bool "Build with newlib float printf"
	help
	  Build with floating point printf enabled. This will increase the size of
	  the image.

config NEWLIB_LIBC_FLOAT_SCANF
	bool "Build with newlib float scanf"
	help
	  Build with floating point scanf enabled. This will increase the size of
	  the image.

config NEWLIB_LIBC_HEAP_LISTENER
	bool "Notify heap listeners of newlib libc heap events"
	select HEAP_LISTENER
	help
	  Notify registered heap listeners upon certain events related to the newlib
	  libc heap usage, such as the heap resize.

config NEWLIB_LIBC_CUSTOM_SBRK
	bool "Allow user to define _sbrk"
	help
	  Allow user to define custom version of the _sbrk function. Some application
	  may need to use the remaining RAM for also other purposes than heap.
