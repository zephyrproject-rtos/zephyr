	help
	  Use picolibc module instead of picolibc included with toolchain

	default -2
	help
	  [DEPRECATED] Use COMMON_LIBC_MALLOC_ARENA_SIZE

	  Indicate the size in bytes of the memory arena used for common C
	  library malloc() implementation when using Picolibc.

	  If set to -2, then the value of COMMON_LIBC_MALLOC_ARENA_SIZE
	  will be used.

config PICOLIBC_IO_LONG_LONG
	bool "support for long long in integer-only printf/scanf"
	help
	  Includes support for long long in integer-only printf/scanf. long long
	  types are always supported in the floating-point versions.

config PICOLIBC_IO_FLOAT
	bool "support for floating point values in printf/scanf"
	help
	  Include floating point support in printf/scanf functions.

config PICOLIBC_FAST_STRCMP
	bool "always use fast strcmp paths"
	default y
	help
	  This provides a faster strcmp version even when libc is
	  built in space-optimized mode

config PICOLIBC_IO_C99_FORMATS
	bool "support C99 format additions in printf/scanf"
	default y
	help
	  Includes support for hex floats (in floating-point version) and j, z,

	bool "Support POSIX positional args (e.g. %$1d) in printf/scanf"
	default y
	depends on !PICOLIBC_IO_FLOAT
	help
	  Includes support for positional args (e.g. $1) in integer-only printf

	  versions.

config PICOLIBC_IO_FLOAT_EXACT
	bool "support for exact float/string conversion"
	default y
	help
	  Uses Ryu algorithm for exact binary/decimal float conversions.
	  This ensures that printf values with enough digits can be
	  fed to scanf and generate exactly the same binary value.

config PICOLIBC_LOCALE_INFO

config PICOLIBC_PICOEXIT
	bool "use smaller atexit/onexit implementation"

	help
	  Provides a simpler atexit/onexit implementation that doesn't use
	  malloc, but only supports a small number (32) of exit handlers.

config PICOLIBC_MULTITHREAD
	bool "support multiple threads using retargetable locking API"
	default y
	help
	  Protects shared data structures in libc with mutexes that use
	  an API which can be retargeted to OS provided routines.

config PICOLIBC_GLOBAL_ERRNO
	bool "use a single global variable for errno"
	help
	  Picolibc usually uses a TLS variable for errno, ensuring that
	  multiple threads have a reliable mechanism for detecting libc
	  exceptions. This option switches to a single global errno variable,
	  which can be used to avoid TLS variable usage by the library if
	  necessary.
