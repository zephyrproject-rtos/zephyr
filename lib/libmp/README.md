# libMP - Media Pipe library

A lightweight, modular media processing pipeline library designed for embedded systems running Zephyr RTOS.

## Overview

libMP provides a flexible framework for building media processing pipelines in resource-constrained environments. It features a pipeline-based architecture with support for various media formats and processing elements.

libMP aims to simplify the development of multimedia applications by:
    • Abstracting buffer management and synchronization between media components.
    • Providing a modular and extensible pipeline architecture.

It also streamlines the development of multimedia components (plugins) by:
    • Offering a consistent, well-defined framework for plugin developers.
    • Enabling reuse across different multimedia components.

## Getting Started

Try one of the examples in samples/subsys/libMP to quickly get started with simple media processing pipelines.

### Prerequisites
- Zephyr RTOS development environment
- CMake build system
- Supported hardware platforms
