config RUST_ALLOC
	bool "Support an allocator in Rust code"
	help
	  If enabled, the Rust zephyr rust support library will include support for an allocator.
	  This allocator will use the currently configured Zephyr allocator (malloc/free). With this
	  enabled, Rust applications can use the `alloc` crate.

config RUST_CHECK_KOBJ_INIT
	bool "Check at runtime that static kobjects are initialized"
	help
	  If enabled, the static kobject support in Rust will use an atomic
	  variable to check that the kobject has had the appropriate
	  initialization done to it.

	  This adds a 32-bit value to each kobject and requires that these kobjects be placed in zero
	  initialized memory. Accesses to the shared variable will invoke an atomic read, and the
	  initializer will have a few atomic operations.
