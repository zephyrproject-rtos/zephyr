	  ZVFS is a central, Zephyr-native library that provides a common interoperable API for all
	  types of file descriptors such as those from the non-virtual FS, sockets, eventfds, FILE *'s
	  and more. It is designed to be used by all Zephyr subsystems that need to work with files.

	help
	  Enable support for ZVFS event file descriptors. An eventfd can
	  be used as an event wait/notify mechanism together with POSIX calls
	  like read, write and poll.
