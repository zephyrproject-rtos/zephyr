	help
	  This option is enabled when the CPU has a Memory Protection Unit (MPU).

	# Hidden config selected by CPU family
	bool
	default n
	help
	This option is enabled when the CPU has hardware floating point
	unit.

menu "ARCv2 Family Options"

config	CPU_ARCV2
	bool
	default y
	help
	  This option signifies the use of a CPU of the ARCv2 family.

config	DATA_ENDIANNESS_LITTLE
	bool
	default y
	help
	  This is driven by the processor implementation, since it is fixed in
	  hardware. The BSP should set this value to 'n' if the data is
	  implemented as big endian.

config	NUM_IRQ_PRIO_LEVELS
	int
	prompt "Number of supported interrupt priority levels"
	range 1 16
	help
	  Interrupt priorities available will be 0 to NUM_IRQ_PRIO_LEVELS-1.
	  The minimum value is 1.

	  The BSP must provide a valid default for proper operation.

config	NUM_IRQS
	int
	prompt "Upper limit of interrupt numbers/IDs used"
	range 17 256
	help
	  Interrupts available will be 0 to NUM_IRQS-1.
	  The minimum value is 17 as the first 16 entries in the vector
	  table are for CPU exceptions.

	  The BSP must provide a valid default. This drives the size of the
	  vector table.

config	RGF_NUM_BANKS
	int
	prompt "Number of General Purpose Register Banks"
	depends on CPU_ARCV2
	range 1 2
	default 2
	help
	The ARC CPU can be configured to have more than one register
	bank. If fast interrupts are supported (FIRQ), the 2nd
	register bank, in the set, will be used by FIRQ interrupts.
	If fast interrupts are supported but there is only 1
	register bank, the fast interrupt handler must save
	and restore general purpose registers.

config	FIRQ_STACK_SIZE
	int
	prompt "Size of stack for FIRQs (in bytes)"
	depends on CPU_ARCV2
	default 1024
	help
	  FIRQs and regular IRQs have different stacks so that a FIRQ can start
	  running without doing stack switching in software.

config	ARC_STACK_CHECKING
	bool "Enable Stack Checking"
	depends on CPU_ARCV2
	select THREAD_STACK_INFO
	default n
	help
	  ARCV2 has a special feature allowing to check stack overflows. This
	  enables code that allows using this debug feature

config	FAULT_DUMP
	int
	prompt "Fault dump level"
	default 2
	range 0 2
	help
	Different levels for display information when a fault occurs.

	2: The default. Display specific and verbose information. Consumes
		the most memory (long strings).

	1: Display general and short information. Consumes less memory
		(short strings).

	0: Off.

config IRQ_OFFLOAD
	bool "Enable IRQ offload"
	default n
	help
	Enable irq_offload() API which allows functions to be synchronously
	run in interrupt context. Uses one entry in the	IDT.  Mainly useful
	for test cases.

config	XIP
	default n if NSIM
	default y

config GEN_ISR_TABLES
	default y

config GEN_IRQ_START_VECTOR
	default 16

config HARVARD
	prompt "Harvard Architecture"
	bool
	default n
	help
	The ARC CPU can be configured to have two busses;
	one for instruction fetching and another that serves as a data bus.

config CODE_DENSITY
	prompt "Code Density Option"
	bool
	default n
	help
	Enable code density option to get better code density

menu "Floating Point Options"
depends on CPU_HAS_FPU

config FLOAT
	bool
	prompt "Floating point registers"
	default n
	help
	This option allows tasks and fibers to use the floating point registers.
	By default, only a single task or fiber may use the registers.

	Disabling this option means that any task or fiber that uses a
	floating point register will get a fatal exception.

config FP_SHARING
	bool
	prompt "Floating point register sharing"
	depends on FLOAT
	default n
	help
	This option allows multiple tasks and fibers to use the floating point
	registers.

config ICCM_SIZE
	int "ICCM Size in kB"
	help
	This option specifies the size of the ICCM in kB.  It is normally set by
	the board's defconfig file and the user should generally avoid modifying
	it via the menu configuration.

config ICCM_BASE_ADDRESS
	hex "ICCM Base Address"
	help
	This option specifies the base address of the ICCM on the board.  It is
	normally set by the board's defconfig file and the user should generally
	avoid modifying it via the menu configuration.

config DCCM_SIZE
	int "DCCM Size in kB"
	help
	This option specifies the size of the DCCM in kB.  It is normally set by
	the board's defconfig file and the user should generally avoid modifying
	it via the menu configuration.

config DCCM_BASE_ADDRESS
	hex "DCCM Base Address"
	help
	This option specifies the base address of the DCCM on the board.  It is
	normally set by the board's defconfig file and the user should generally
	avoid modifying it via the menu configuration.

config SRAM_SIZE
	int "SRAM Size in kB"
	help
	This option specifies the size of the SRAM in kB.  It is normally set by
	the board's defconfig file and the user should generally avoid modifying
	it via the menu configuration.

config SRAM_BASE_ADDRESS
	hex "SRAM Base Address"
	help
	This option specifies the base address of the SRAM on the board.  It is
	normally set by the board's defconfig file and the user should generally
	avoid modifying it via the menu configuration.

config FLASH_SIZE
	int "Flash Size in kB"
	help
	This option specifies the size of the flash in kB.  It is normally set by
	the board's defconfig file and the user should generally avoid modifying
	it via the menu configuration.

config FLASH_BASE_ADDRESS
	hex "Flash Base Address"
	help
	This option specifies the base address of the flash on the board.  It is
	normally set by the board's defconfig file and the user should generally
	avoid modifying it via the menu configuration.

config CACHE_LINE_SIZE_DETECT
	bool
	prompt "Detect d-cache line size at runtime"
	default n
	help
	This option enables querying the d-cache build register for finding
	the d-cache line size at the expense of taking more memory and code
	and a slightly increased boot time.

	If the CPU's d-cache line size is known in advance, disable this
	option and manually enter the value for CACHE_LINE_SIZE.

config CACHE_LINE_SIZE
	int
	prompt "Cache line size" if !CACHE_LINE_SIZE_DETECT
	default 32
	help
	Size in bytes of a CPU d-cache line.

	Detect automatically at runtime by selecting CACHE_LINE_SIZE_DETECT.

config ARCH_CACHE_FLUSH_DETECT
	bool
	default n

config CACHE_FLUSHING
	bool
	default n
	prompt "Enable d-cache flushing mechanism"
	help
	This links in the sys_cache_flush() function, which provides a
	way to flush multiple lines of the d-cache.
	If the d-cache is present, set this to y.
	If the d-cache is NOT present, set this to n.
