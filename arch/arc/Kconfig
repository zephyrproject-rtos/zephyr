	  This option signifies the use of a CPU of the ARCv2 family.

config NUM_IRQ_PRIO_LEVELS
	int "Number of supported interrupt priority levels"
	range 1 16
	help
	  Interrupt priorities available will be 0 to NUM_IRQ_PRIO_LEVELS-1.
	  The minimum value is 1.

	  The BSP must provide a valid default for proper operation.

config NUM_IRQS
	int "Upper limit of interrupt numbers/IDs used"
	range 17 256
	help
	  Interrupts available will be 0 to NUM_IRQS-1.
	  The minimum value is 17 as the first 16 entries in the vector
	  table are for CPU exceptions.

	  The BSP must provide a valid default. This drives the size of the
	  vector table.

config RGF_NUM_BANKS
	int "Number of General Purpose Register Banks"
	depends on CPU_ARCV2
	range 1 2
	default 2
	help
	  The ARC CPU can be configured to have more than one register
	  bank. If fast interrupts are supported (FIRQ), the 2nd
	  register bank, in the set, will be used by FIRQ interrupts.
	  If fast interrupts are supported but there is only 1
	  register bank, the fast interrupt handler must save
	  and restore general purpose registers.

config ARC_FIRQ
	bool "FIRQ enable"
	default y
	help
	  Fast interrupts are supported (FIRQ). If FIRQ enabled, for interrupts
	  with highest priority, status32 and pc will be saved in aux regs,
	  other regs will be saved according to the number of register bank;
	  If FIRQ is disabled, the handle of interrupts with highest priority
	  will be same with other interrupts.

config ARC_FIRQ_STACK
	bool "Enable separate firq stack"
	depends on ARC_FIRQ && RGF_NUM_BANKS > 1
	help
	  Use separate stack for FIRQ handing. When the fast irq is also a direct
	  irq, this will get the minimal interrupt latency.

config ARC_FIRQ_STACK_SIZE
	int "FIRQ stack size"
	depends on ARC_FIRQ_STACK
	default 1024
	help
	  The size of firq stack.

config ARC_HAS_STACK_CHECKING
	bool "ARC has STACK_CHECKING"
	default y
	help
	  ARC is configured with STACK_CHECKING which is a mechanism for
	  checking stack accesses and raising an exception when a stack
	  overflow or underflow is detected.

config ARC_CONNECT
	bool "ARC has ARC connect"
	select SCHED_IPI_SUPPORTED
	help
	  ARC is configured with ARC CONNECT which is a hardware for connecting
	  multi cores.

config ARC_STACK_CHECKING
	bool
	select NO_UNUSED_STACK_INSPECTION
	help
	  Use ARC STACK_CHECKING to do stack protection

config ARC_STACK_PROTECTION

	select MPU_STACK_GUARD if (!ARC_STACK_CHECKING && ARC_MPU && ARC_MPU_VER !=2)
	select THREAD_STACK_INFO
	help
	  This option enables either:
	  - The ARC stack checking, or
	  - the MPU-based stack guard
	  to cause a system fatal error
	  if the bounds of the current process stack are overflowed.
	  The two stack guard options are mutually exclusive. The
	  selection of the ARC stack checking is
	  prioritized over the MPU-based stack guard.

config ARC_USE_UNALIGNED_MEM_ACCESS
	bool "Enable unaligned access in HW"
	default y if CPU_ARCHS
	depends on (CPU_ARCEM && !ARC_HAS_SECURE) || CPU_ARCHS
	help
	  ARC EM cores w/o secure shield 2+2 mode support might be configured
	  to support unaligned memory access which is then disabled by default.
	  Enable unaligned access in hardware and make software to use it.

config FAULT_DUMP
	int "Fault dump level"
	default 2
	range 0 2
	help
	  Different levels for display information when a fault occurs.

	  2: The default. Display specific and verbose information. Consumes
		the most memory (long strings).

	  1: Display general and short information. Consumes less memory
		(short strings).

	  0: Off.

config GEN_ISR_TABLES
	default y

config GEN_IRQ_START_VECTOR
	default 16

config HARVARD
	bool "Harvard Architecture"
	help
	  The ARC CPU can be configured to have two busses;
	  one for instruction fetching and another that serves as a data bus.

config CODE_DENSITY
	bool "Code Density Option"
	help
	  Enable code density option to get better code density

config ARC_HAS_ACCL_REGS
	bool "Reg Pair ACCL:ACCH (FPU and/or MPY > 6)"
	default y if FPU
	help
	  Depending on the configuration, CPU can contain accumulator reg-pair
	  (also referred to as r58:r59). These can also be used by gcc as GPR so
	  kernel needs to save/restore per process

config ARC_HAS_SECURE
	bool "ARC has SecureShield"
	select CPU_HAS_TEE
	select ARCH_HAS_TRUSTED_EXECUTION
	help
	  This option is enabled when ARC core supports secure mode

config SJLI_TABLE_SIZE
	int "SJLI table size"
	depends on ARC_SECURE_FIRMWARE
	default 8
	help
	  The size of sjli (Secure Jump and Link Indexed) table. The
	  code in normal mode call secure services in secure mode through
	  sjli instruction.

config ARC_SECURE_FIRMWARE
	bool "Generate Secure Firmware"
	depends on ARC_HAS_SECURE
	default y if TRUSTED_EXECUTION_SECURE
	help
	  This option indicates that we are building a Zephyr image that
	  is intended to execute in secure mode. The option is only
	  applicable to ARC processors that implement the SecureShield.

	  This option enables Zephyr to include code that executes in
	  secure mode, as well as to exclude code that is designed to
	  execute only in normal mode.

	  Code executing in secure mode has access to both the secure
	  and normal resources of the ARC processors.

config ARC_NORMAL_FIRMWARE
	bool "Generate Normal Firmware"
	depends on !ARC_SECURE_FIRMWARE
	depends on ARC_HAS_SECURE
	default y if TRUSTED_EXECUTION_NONSECURE
	help
	  This option indicates that we are building a Zephyr image that
	  is intended to execute in normal mode. Execution of this
	  image is triggered by secure firmware that executes in secure
	  mode. The option is only applicable to ARC processors that
	  implement the SecureShield.

	  This option enables Zephyr to include code that executes in
	  normal mode only, as well as to exclude code that is
	  designed to execute only in secure mode.

	  Code executing in normal mode has no access to secure
	  resources of the ARC processors, and, therefore, it shall avoid
	  accessing them.
