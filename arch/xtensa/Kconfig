config IRQ_OFFLOAD_INTNUM
	int "IRQ offload SW interrupt index"
	help
	  The index of the software interrupt to be used for IRQ offload.

	  Please note that in order for IRQ offload to work correctly the selected
	  interrupt shall have its priority shall not exceed XCHAL_EXCM_LEVEL.

config ARCH
	default "xtensa"

config SIMULATOR_XTENSA
	bool "Simulator Configuration"
	help
	  Specify if the board configuration should be treated as a simulator.

config SYS_CLOCK_HW_CYCLES_PER_SEC
	prompt "Hardware clock cycles per second, 2000000 for ISS"
	default 2000000
	range 1000000 1000000000
	help
	  This option specifies hardware clock.

config XTENSA_NO_IPC
	bool "Core has no IPC support"
	select ATOMIC_OPERATIONS_C
	help
	  Uncheck this if your core does not implement "SCOMPARE1" register and "s32c1i"
	  instruction.

config XTENSA_RESET_VECTOR
	bool "Build reset vector code"
	default y
	help
	  This option controls whether the initial reset vector code is built.
	  This is always needed for the simulator. Real boards may already
	  implement this in boot ROM.

config XTENSA_USE_CORE_CRT1
	bool "Use crt1.S from core"
	default y
	help
	  SoC or boards might define their own __start by setting this setting
	  to false.

config XTENSA_KERNEL_CPU_PTR_SR
	string
	default "MISC0"
	help
	  Specify which special register to store the pointer to
	  _kernel.cpus[] for the current CPU.

config XTENSA_ENABLE_BACKTRACE
	bool "Enable backtrace on panic exception"
	default y
	depends on SOC_ESP32
	help
	  Enable this config option to print backtrace on panic exception

config XTENSA_CPU_IDLE_SPIN
	bool "Use busy loop for k_cpu_idle"
	help
	  Use a spin loop instead of WAITI for the CPU idle state.

config XTENSA_WAITI_BUG
	bool "Enable workaround sequence for WAITI bug on LX6"
	help
	  SOF traditionally contains this workaround on its ADSP
	  platforms which prefixes a WAITI entry with 128 NOP
	  instructions followed by an ISYNC and EXTW.

config XTENSA_SMALL_VECTOR_TABLE_ENTRY
	bool "Enable workaround for small vector table entries"
	help
	  This option enables a small indirection to bypass the size
	  constraint of the vector table entry and moved the default
	  handlers to the end of vector table, renaming them to
	  _Level\LVL\()VectorHelper.
