# this isn't as optimal as I'd hoped.  the individual cases are tested
# using a L32R + BNONE (i.e. a full mask test) instead of a BBSI, and
# the handlers are being invoked with CALL8 instead of CALL4,
# inexplicably wasting four words of stack.  Maybe this should be
# emitting assembly instead.  Wouldn't be much more complicated and
# would share all the same structure.

# My manual count of instructions says that a linear search becomes
# faster on average when there are three or fewer bits to test.  Would
# be four, if the compiler would generate BBSI instructions.
