config INCLUDE_RESET_VECTOR
	bool "Include Reset vector"
	help
	  Include the reset vector stub, which initializes the stack and
	  prepares for running C code.

config RISCV_SOC_CONTEXT_SAVE
	bool "Enable SOC-based context saving in IRQ handlers"
	select RISCV_SOC_OFFSETS
	help
	  Enable low-level SOC-specific context management, for SOCs
	  with extra state that must be saved when entering an
	  interrupt/exception, and restored on exit. If unsure, leave
	  this at the default value.

	  Enabling this option requires that the SoC provide a
	  soc_context.h header which defines the following macros:

	  - SOC_ESF_MEMBERS: structure component declarations to
	    allocate space for. The last such declaration should not
	    end in a semicolon, for portability. The generic RISC-V
	    architecture code will allocate space for these members in
	    a "struct soc_esf" type (typedefed to soc_esf_t), which will
	    be available if arch.h is included.

	  - SOC_ESF_INIT: structure contents initializer for struct soc_esf
	    state. The last initialized member should not end in a comma.

	  The generic architecture IRQ wrapper will also call
	  \_\_soc_save_context and \_\_soc_restore_context routines at
	  ISR entry and exit, respectively. These should typically
	  be implemented in assembly. If they were C functions, they
	  would have these signatures:

	  ``void __soc_save_context(soc_esf_t *state);``

	  ``void __soc_restore_context(soc_esf_t *state);``

	  The calls obey standard calling conventions; i.e., the state
	  pointer address is in a0, and ra contains the return address.

config RISCV_SOC_OFFSETS
	bool "Enable SOC-based offsets"
	help
	  Enabling this option requires that the SoC provide a soc_offsets.h
	  header which defines the following macros:

	  - GEN_SOC_OFFSET_SYMS(): a macro which expands to
	    GEN_OFFSET_SYM(soc_esf_t, soc_specific_member) calls
	    to ensure offset macros for SOC_ESF_MEMBERS are defined
	    in offsets.h. The last one should not end in a semicolon.
	    See gen_offset.h for more details.

config RISCV_SOC_INTERRUPT_INIT
	bool "Enable SOC-based interrupt initialization"
	help
	  Enable SOC-based interrupt initialization
	  (call soc_interrupt_init, within _IntLibInit when enabled)

config RISCV_GENERIC_TOOLCHAIN
	bool "Compile using generic riscv32 toolchain"
	default y
	help
	  Compile using generic riscv32 toolchain.
	  Allow SOCs that have custom extended riscv ISA to still
	  compile with generic riscv32 toolchain.
