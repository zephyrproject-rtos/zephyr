	  This option enables the hard-float calling convention.

config RISCV_GP
	bool "Enable RISC-V global pointer relative addressing"
	default n
	help
	  Use global pointer relative addressing for small globals declared
	  anywhere in the executable. It can benefit performance and reduce
	  the code size.

	  Note: To support this feature, RISC-V SoC needs to initialize
	  global pointer at program start or earlier than any instruction
	  using GP relative addressing.

	bool "Use E31 core"
	select RISCV_PMP

	  This option signifies the use of a core of the E31 family.

config INCLUDE_RESET_VECTOR
	bool "Include Reset vector"
	help
	  Include the reset vector stub, which initializes the stack and
	  prepares for running C code.

config RISCV_SOC_CONTEXT_SAVE
	bool "Enable SOC-based context saving in IRQ handlers"
	select RISCV_SOC_OFFSETS
	help
	  Enable low-level SOC-specific context management, for SOCs
	  with extra state that must be saved when entering an
	  interrupt/exception, and restored on exit. If unsure, leave
	  this at the default value.

	  Enabling this option requires that the SoC provide a
	  soc_context.h header which defines the following macros:

	  - SOC_ESF_MEMBERS: structure component declarations to
	    allocate space for. The last such declaration should not
	    end in a semicolon, for portability. The generic RISC-V
	    architecture code will allocate space for these members in
	    a "struct soc_esf" type (typedefed to soc_esf_t), which will
	    be available if arch.h is included.

	  - SOC_ESF_INIT: structure contents initializer for struct soc_esf
	    state. The last initialized member should not end in a comma.

	  The generic architecture IRQ wrapper will also call
	  \_\_soc_save_context and \_\_soc_restore_context routines at
	  ISR entry and exit, respectively. These should typically
	  be implemented in assembly. If they were C functions, they
	  would have these signatures:

	  ``void __soc_save_context(soc_esf_t *state);``

	  ``void __soc_restore_context(soc_esf_t *state);``

	  The calls obey standard calling conventions; i.e., the state
	  pointer address is in a0, and ra contains the return address.

config RISCV_SOC_OFFSETS
	bool "Enable SOC-based offsets"
	help
	  Enabling this option requires that the SoC provide a soc_offsets.h
	  header which defines the following macros:

	  - GEN_SOC_OFFSET_SYMS(): a macro which expands to
	    GEN_OFFSET_SYM(soc_esf_t, soc_specific_member) calls
	    to ensure offset macros for SOC_ESF_MEMBERS are defined
	    in offsets.h. The last one should not end in a semicolon.
	    See gen_offset.h for more details.

config RISCV_SOC_INTERRUPT_INIT
	bool "Enable SOC-based interrupt initialization"
	help
	  Enable SOC-based interrupt initialization
	  (call soc_interrupt_init, within _IntLibInit when enabled)

config RISCV_GENERIC_TOOLCHAIN
	bool "Compile using generic riscv32 toolchain"
	default y
	help
	  Compile using generic riscv32 toolchain.
	  Allow SOCs that have custom extended riscv ISA to still
	  compile with generic riscv32 toolchain.

config HAS_MONITOR_HART
	bool "Does SOC have monitor hart with different capabilities to application harts"
	default n
	help
	  SOC has monitor hart such as the e51 on MPFS and FU540 which has different
	  capabilities to the other harts in the SOC. This may be important for SMP
	  setups where the monitor hart may not be suitable for inclusion in the SMP
	  operation.
	  
config MONITOR_HART_ID
	int "Hart id for monitor hart"
	default 0
	help
	  If the SOC has monitor hart such as the e51 on MPFS and FU540 this is
	  the mhartid value for the monitor hart.
	  
config MONITOR_HART_SUPERVISOR
	bool "Monitor hart supports supervisor mode"
	default n
	help
	  If the SOC has monitor hart, this flag indicates if it supports supervisor
	  mode. Many monitor harts such as the e51 on MPFS and FU540 do not support
	  supervisor mode.
	  
config SUPERVISOR_MODE_CAPABLE
	bool "Indicates that supervisor mode is available"
	default y
	help
	  Indicates supervisor mode is supported by the device. This may mean we need
	  to implement supervisor specific code even if Zephyr is not using this mode.
	  Please note, not all harts on a device might support supervisor mode so this
	  is not a carte blanche.

config NO_SUPERVISOR_DELEGATION
	bool "For harts which support supervisor mode, force clearing of delegation bits"
	default y
	help
	  Force clearing of supervisor delegation bits on start up to avoid unexpected
	  exceptions.

config SET_SUPERVISOR_HANDLER
	bool "Set up a dummy handler to catch unexpected supervisor traps"
	default n
	help
	  Setup a dummy trap handler for supervisor exceptions. This may be required for 
	  system stability to avoid unexpected behaviour if a supervisor trap triggers.

config HART_TO_USE
	int "Select single hart to run Zephyr on, or start up hart in SMP mode"
	range 0 4
	default 0
	help
	  For non SMP setups this indicates which hart we are running Zephyr on. For SMP
	  setups this indicates which hart will take care of system startup.
	  
config CLEAR_PMP_REGS
	bool "Do we need to clear the PMP registers on startup"
	default n
	help
	  Typically, on RISC-V setups, the PMP registers are left with random values
	  on power up. The values are supposed to be benign but sometimes there can be
	  issues. If the registers are not set to valid values by the bootloader or other
	  agent, then zeroing them can help with system stability.
