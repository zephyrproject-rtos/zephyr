	  This option enables the hard-float calling convention.

config RISCV_GP
	bool "RISC-V global pointer relative addressing"
	default n
	help
	  Use global pointer relative addressing for small globals declared
	  anywhere in the executable. It can benefit performance and reduce
	  the code size.

	  Note: To support this feature, RISC-V SoC needs to initialize
	  global pointer at program start or earlier than any instruction
	  using GP relative addressing.

config RISCV_ALWAYS_SWITCH_THROUGH_ECALL

	depends on !RISCV_PMP
	help
	  Use mret instruction only when in a trap handler.
	  This is for RISC-V implementations that require every mret to be
	  balanced with an ecall. This is not required by the RISC-V spec
	  and most people should say n here to minimize context switching
	  overhead.

config RISCV_PRIVILEGED
	bool
	select ARCH_HAS_RAMFUNC_SUPPORT if XIP
	help
	  Option selected by SoCs implementing the RISC-V privileged ISA.

config RISCV_SOC_HAS_ISR_STACKING
	bool
	depends on !USERSPACE
	help
	  Enable low-level SOC-specific hardware stacking / unstacking
	  operations during ISR. This hidden option needs to be selected by SoC
	  if this feature is supported.

	  Some SOCs implement a mechanism for which, on interrupt handling,
	  part of the context is automatically saved by the hardware on the
	  stack according to a custom ESF format. The same part of the context
	  is automatically restored by hardware on mret.

	  Enabling this option requires that the SoC provides a
	  soc_isr_stacking.h header which defines the following:

	  - SOC_ISR_SW_STACKING: macro guarded by _ASMLANGUAGE called by the
	    IRQ wrapper assembly code on ISR entry to save in the ESF the
	    remaining part of the context not pushed already on the stack by
	    the hardware.

	  - SOC_ISR_SW_UNSTACKING: macro guarded by _ASMLANGUAGE called by the
	    IRQ wrapper assembly code on ISR exit to restore the part of the
	    context from the ESF that won't be restored by hardware on mret.

	  - SOC_ISR_STACKING_ESF_DECLARE: structure declaration for the ESF
	    guarded by !_ASMLANGUAGE. The ESF should be defined to account for
	    the hardware stacked registers in the proper order as they are
	    saved on the stack by the hardware, and the registers saved by the
	    software macros. The structure must be called '__esf'.

config RISCV_SOC_HAS_CUSTOM_IRQ_HANDLING
	bool
	help
	  This allows the SoC to overwrite the irq handling. If enabled, the
	  function __soc_handle_all_irqs has to be implemented. It shall service
	  and clear all pending interrupts.

config RISCV_SOC_HAS_CUSTOM_IRQ_LOCK_OPS
	bool
	help
	  Hidden option to allow SoC to overwrite arch_irq_lock(),
	  arch_irq_unlock() and arch_irq_unlocked() functions with
	  platform-specific versions named z_soc_irq_lock(), z_soc_irq_unlock()
	  and z_soc_irq_unlocked().

	  Enable this hidden option and specialize the z_soc_* functions when
	  the RISC-V SoC needs to do something different and more than reading and
	  writing the mstatus register to lock and unlock the IRQs.

config RISCV_SOC_HAS_CUSTOM_SYS_IO
	bool
	help
	  Hidden option to allow SoC to overwrite sys_read*(), sys_write*() functions with
	  platform-specific versions named z_soc_sys_read*() and z_soc_sys_write*().

	  Enable this hidden option and specialize the z_soc_* functions when
	  the RISC-V SoC needs to do something different and more than reading and
	  writing the registers.

config RISCV_SOC_CONTEXT_SAVE
	bool "SOC-based context saving in IRQ handlers"
	select RISCV_SOC_OFFSETS
	help
	  Enable low-level SOC-specific context management, for SOCs
	  with extra state that must be saved when entering an
	  interrupt/exception, and restored on exit. If unsure, leave
	  this at the default value.

	  Enabling this option requires that the SoC provide a
	  soc_context.h header which defines the following macros:

	  - SOC_ESF_MEMBERS: structure component declarations to
	    allocate space for. The last such declaration should not
	    end in a semicolon, for portability. The generic RISC-V
	    architecture code will allocate space for these members in
	    a "struct soc_esf" type (typedefed to soc_esf_t), which will
	    be available if arch.h is included.

	  - SOC_ESF_INIT: structure contents initializer for struct soc_esf
	    state. The last initialized member should not end in a comma.

	  The generic architecture IRQ wrapper will also call
	  \_\_soc_save_context and \_\_soc_restore_context routines at
	  ISR entry and exit, respectively. These should typically
	  be implemented in assembly. If they were C functions, they
	  would have these signatures:

	  ``void __soc_save_context(soc_esf_t *state);``

	  ``void __soc_restore_context(soc_esf_t *state);``

	  The calls obey standard calling conventions; i.e., the state
	  pointer address is in a0, and ra contains the return address.

config RISCV_SOC_OFFSETS
	bool "SOC-based offsets"
	help
	  Enabling this option requires that the SoC provide a soc_offsets.h
	  header which defines the following macros:

	  - GEN_SOC_OFFSET_SYMS(): a macro which expands to
	    GEN_OFFSET_SYM(soc_esf_t, soc_specific_member) calls
	    to ensure offset macros for SOC_ESF_MEMBERS are defined
	    in offsets.h. The last one should not end in a semicolon.
	    See gen_offset.h for more details.

config RISCV_HAS_PLIC

	help
	  On some RISCV platform the first interrupt vectors are primarly
	  intended for inter-hart interrupt signaling and so retained for that
	  purpose and not available. When this option is set, all the IRQ
	  vectors are shifted by this offset value when installed into the
	  software ISR table and the IRQ vector table. CONFIG_NUM_IRQS must be
	  properly sized to take into account this offset. This is a hidden
	  option which needs to be set per architecture and left alone.
