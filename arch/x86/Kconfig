config ADVANCED_IDLE
	bool
	prompt "Advanced idle state"
	default n
	depends on ADVANCED_POWER_MANAGEMENT && ADVANCED_IDLE_SUPPORTED
	help
	This option enables the kernel to interface to a custom advanced idle
	power saving manager. This permits the system to enter a custom
	power saving state when the kernel becomes idle for extended periods,
	and then to restore the system to its previous state (rather than
	booting up from scratch) when the kernel is re-activated.

config ADV_IDLE_STACK_SIZE
	int
	prompt "Advanced idle state stack size"
	default 16
	depends on ADVANCED_IDLE
	help
	This option defines the size of the separate stack used during the
	system state check while the booting up. A separate stack is used
	to avoid memory corruption on the system re-activation from power
	down mode. The stack size must be large enough to hold the return
	address (4 bytes) and the _AdvIdleCheckSleep() stack frame.

config CPU_MIGHT_SUPPORT_CLFLUSH

config CLFLUSH_INSTRUCTION_SUPPORTED

	an implementation of _SysCacheFlush() that uses CLFLUSH is made
	available, instead of the one using WBINVD.

	This option signifies that the target supports hardware-based
	instruction breakpoints and/or data watchpoints.

config TICKLESS_IDLE_UNSUPPORTED

	bool
	default n
	help
	This option signifies the use of an Intel CPU that lacks
	support for tickless idle.

	This option signifies the use of an Intel CPU that lacks support
	for SSEx instructions (i.e. those which pre-date Pentium III).

config  FLOAT
	bool
	prompt "Floating point instructions"
	default n
	select FP_SHARING if ENHANCED_SECURITY
	help
	This option enables the use of x87 FPU and MMX instructions by
	a task or fiber.

	Disabling this option means that any task or fiber that uses a
	floating point instruction will get a fatal exception.

config  SSE
	bool
	prompt "SSEx instructions"
	depends on FLOAT && !CPU_SSE_UNSUPPORTED
	default n
	help
	This option enables the use of SSEx instructions by a task or fiber.

	Disabling this option means that no task or fiber may use SSEx
	instructions; any such use will result in undefined behavior.

config SSE_FP_MATH
	bool
	prompt "Compiler-generated SSEx instructions" if FP_SHARING
	depends on SSE && ISA_IA32
	default n if FP_SHARING
	default y if !FP_SHARING
	help
	This option allows the compiler to generate SSEx instructions for
	performing floating point math. This can greatly improve performance
	when exactly the same operations are to be performed on multiple
	data objects; however, it can also significantly reduce performance
	when pre-emptive task switches occur because of the larger register
	set that must be saved and restored.

	Disabling this option means that the compiler utilizes only the
	x87 instruction set for floating point operations.

config  FP_SHARING
	bool
	prompt "Floating point resource sharing" if !ENHANCED_SECURITY
	depends on FLOAT
	default n
	select AUTOMATIC_FP_ENABLING if ENHANCED_SECURITY
	help
	This option allows multiple tasks and fibers to safely utilize
	floating point hardware resources. Every task or fiber that wishes
	to use floating point instructions (i.e. x87 FPU, MMX, or SSEx) must
	be created with such support already enabled, or must enable this
	support via task_float_enable() or fiber_float_enable() before
	executing these instructions.

	Enabling this option adds 108 bytes to the stack size requirement
	of each task or fiber that utilizes x87 FPU or MMX instructions,
	and adds 464 bytes to the stack size requirement of each task or
	fiber that utilizes SSEx instructions. (The stack size requirement
	of tasks and fibers that do not utilize floating point instructions
	remains unchanged.)

	Disabling this option means that only a single task or fiber may
	utilize x87 FPU, MMX, or SSEx instructions. (The stack size
	requirement of all tasks and fibers remains unchanged.)

config  AUTOMATIC_FP_ENABLING
	bool
	prompt "Automatically enable floating point resource sharing" \
	       if !ENHANCED_SECURITY
	depends on FP_SHARING
	default n
	help
	This option allows tasks and fibers to safely utilize floating
	point hardware resources without requiring them to first indicate
	their intention to do so. The system automatically detects when
	a task or fiber that does not currently have floating point support
	enabled uses a floating point instruction, and automatically executes
	task_float_enable() or fiber_float_enable() on its behalf. The
	task or fiber is enabled for using x87 FPU, MMX, or SSEx instructions
	if SSE is configured, otherwise it is enabled for using x87 FPU or
	MMX instructions only.
