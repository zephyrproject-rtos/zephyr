	  regions.

	  Note that this does not include the "locore" which contains real mode

	help
	  Embed a multiboot header in the output executable. This is used
	  by some boot loaders (e.g., GRUB) when loading Zephyr. It is safe
	  to leave this option on if you're not sure. It only expands the
	  text segment by 12-16 bytes and is typically ignored if not needed.

config MULTIBOOT_INFO
	bool "Preserve multiboot information structure"
	help
	  Multiboot passes a pointer to an information structure to the
	  kernel entry point. Some drivers (e.g., the multiboot framebuffer
	  display driver) need to refer to information in this structure,
	  and so set this option to preserve the data in a permanent location.

config MULTIBOOT_MEMMAP

config X86_VERY_EARLY_CONSOLE
	bool "Support very early boot printk"
	depends on PRINTK
	default y
	help
	  Non-emulated X86 devices often require special hardware to attach
	  a debugger, which may not be easily available. This option adds a
	  very minimal serial driver which gets initialized at the very
	  beginning of z_cstart(), via arch_kernel_init(). This driver enables
	  printk to emit messages to the 16550 UART port 0 instance in device
	  tree. This mini-driver assumes I/O to the UART is done via ports.

config X86_MMU
	bool "Enable Memory Management Unit"
	select MMU

	  This options enables the memory management unit present in x86
	  and creates a set of page tables at boot time that is runtime-

	bool "Use a single page table for all threads"
	default n
	depends on USERSPACE
	depends on !SMP
	depends on !X86_KPTI
	help
	  If this option is enabled, userspace memory domains will not have their
	  own page tables. Instead, context switching operations will modify
	  page tables in place. This is much slower, but uses much less RAM
	  for page tables.

config X86_MAX_ADDITIONAL_MEM_DOMAINS
	int "Maximum number of memory domains"
	default 3
	depends on X86_MMU && USERSPACE && !X86_COMMON_PAGE_TABLE
	help
	  The initial page tables at boot are pre-allocated, and used for the
	  default memory domain. Instantiation of additional memory domains
	  if common page tables are in use requires a pool of free pinned
	  memory pages for constructing page tables.

	  Zephyr test cases assume 3 additional domains can be instantiated.

config X86_NO_MELTDOWN
	bool
	help
	  This hidden option should be set on a per-SOC basis to indicate that
	  a particular SOC is not vulnerable to the Meltdown CPU vulnerability,

config X86_NO_SPECTRE_V1

	help
	  This hidden option should be set on a per-SOC basis to indicate that
	  a particular SOC is not vulnerable to the Spectre V1, V1.1, V1.2, and
	  swapgs CPU vulnerabilities as described in CVE-2017-5753,
	  CVE-2018-3693, and CVE-2019-1125.

config X86_NO_SPECTRE_V2
	bool
	help
	  This hidden option should be set on a per-SOC basis to indicate that

	  vulnerability, as described in CVE-2017-5715.

config X86_NO_SPECTRE_V4
	bool
	help
	  This hidden option should be set on a per-SOC basis to indicate that
	  a particular SOC is not vulnerable to the Spectre V4 CPU
	  vulnerability, as described in CVE-2018-3639.

config X86_NO_LAZY_FP
	bool
	help
	  This hidden option should be set on a per-SOC basis to indicate
	  that a particular SOC is not vulnerable to the Lazy FP CPU
	  vulnerability, as described in CVE-2018-3665.

	select X86_NO_SPECTRE_V2
	select X86_NO_SPECTRE_V4
	select X86_NO_LAZY_FP
	help
	  This hidden option should be set on a per-SOC basis to indicate that
	  a particular SOC does not perform any kind of speculative execution,
	  or is a newer chip which is immune to the class of vulnerabilities
	  which exploit speculative execution side channel attacks.

config DISABLE_SSBD
	bool "Disable Speculative Store Bypass"
	depends on USERSPACE
	default y if !X86_NO_SPECTRE_V4
	help
	  This option will disable Speculative Store Bypass in order to
	  mitigate against certain kinds of side channel attacks.  Quoting
	  the "Speculative Execution Side Channels" document, version 2.0:

	      When SSBD is set, loads will not execute speculatively
	      until the addresses of all older stores are known.  This
	      ensure s that a load does not speculatively consume stale
	      data values due to bypassing an older store on the same
	      logical processor.

	  If enabled, this applies to all threads in the system.

	  Even if enabled, will have no effect on CPUs that do not
	  require this feature.

config ENABLE_EXTENDED_IBRS
	bool "Enable Extended IBRS"
	depends on USERSPACE
	default y if !X86_NO_SPECTRE_V2
	help
	  This option will enable the Extended Indirect Branch Restricted
	  Speculation 'always on' feature. This mitigates Indirect Branch
	  Control vulnerabilities (aka Spectre V2).

config X86_BOUNDS_CHECK_BYPASS_MITIGATION
	bool
	depends on USERSPACE
	default y if !X86_NO_SPECTRE_V1
	select BOUNDS_CHECK_BYPASS_MITIGATION
	help
	  Hidden config to select arch-independent option to enable
	  Spectre V1 mitigations by default if the CPU is not known
	  to be immune to it.

config X86_KPTI
	bool "Enable kernel page table isolation"
	default y
	depends on USERSPACE
	depends on !X86_NO_MELTDOWN
	help
	  Implements kernel page table isolation to mitigate Meltdown exploits
	  to read Kernel RAM. Incurs a significant performance cost for
	  user thread interrupts and system calls, and significant footprint
	  increase for additional page tables and trampoline stacks.
