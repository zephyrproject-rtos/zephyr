 * @brief Floating point register sharing routines
 *
 * This module allows multiple preemptible threads to safely share the system's
 * floating point registers, by allowing the system to save FPU state info
 * in a thread's stack region when a preemptive context switch occurs.
 *
 * Note: If the kernel has been built without floating point register sharing
 * support (CONFIG_FPU_SHARING), the floating point registers can still be used
 * safely by one or more cooperative threads OR by a single preemptive thread,
 * but not by both.
 *
 * This code is not necessary for systems with CONFIG_EAGER_FPU_SHARING, as
 * the floating point context is unconditionally saved/restored with every
 * context switch.
 *
 * The floating point register sharing mechanism is designed for minimal
 * intrusiveness.  Floating point state saving is only performed for threads
 * that explicitly indicate they are using FPU registers, to avoid impacting
 * the stack size requirements of all other threads. Also, the SSE registers
 * are only saved for threads that actually used them. For those threads that
 * do require floating point state saving, a "lazy save/restore" mechanism
 * is employed so that the FPU's register sets are only switched in and out
 * when absolutely necessary; this avoids wasting effort preserving them when
 * there is no risk that they will be altered, or when there is no need to
 * preserve their contents.
 *
 * WARNING
 * The use of floating point instructions by ISRs is not supported by the
 * kernel.
 *
 * INTERNAL
 * The kernel sets CR0[TS] to 0 only for threads that require FP register
 * sharing. All other threads have CR0[TS] set to 1 so that an attempt
 * to perform an FP operation will cause an exception, allowing the kernel
 * to enable FP register sharing on its behalf.
