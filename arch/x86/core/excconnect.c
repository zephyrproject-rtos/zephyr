/*
 * DESCRIPTION
 * This module provides routines to manage exceptions (synchronous interrupts)
 * on the IA-32 architecture.
 *
 * This module provides the public routine nanoCpuExcConnect().
 *
 * INTERNAL
 * An exception is defined as a synchronous interrupt, i.e. an interrupt
 * asserted as a direct result of program execution as opposed to a
 * hardware device asserting an interrupt.
 *
 * Many (but not all) exceptions are handled by an "exception stub" whose code
 * is generated by the system itself.  The stub performs various actions before
 * and after invoking the application (or operating system) specific exception
 * handler; for example, a thread or ISR context save is performed prior to
 * invoking the exception handler.
 *
 * The IA-32 code that makes up a "full" exception stub is shown below.  A full
 * exception stub is one that pushes a dummy error code at the start of
 * exception processing.  Exception types where the processor automatically
 * pushes an error code when handling an exception utilize similar exception
 * stubs, however the first instruction is omitted.  The use of the dummy error
 * code means that _ExcEnt() and _ExcExit() do not have to worry about whether
 * an error code is present on the stack or not.
 *
 *
 *   0x00   pushl   $0			/@ push dummy error code @/
 *   Machine code:  0x68, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00
 *
 *   0x05   call    _ExcEnt		/@ inform kernel of exception @/
 *   Machine code:  0xe8, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00
 *
 *   0x0a   call    ExcHandler		/@ invoke exception handler @/
 *   Machine code: 0xe8, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00
 *
 *   /@ _ExcExit() will adjust the stack to discard the error code @/
 *
 *   0x0f  jmp	   _ExcExit		/@ restore thread context @/
 *   Machine code: 0xe9, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00
 *
 * NOTE: Be sure to update the arch specific definition of the _EXC_STUB_SIZE
 * macro to reflect the size of the full exception stub (as shown above).
 * The _EXC_STUB_SIZE macro is defined in arch/x86/include/nano_private.h.

 * interrupt vector.  An exception is defined as a synchronous interrupt, i.e.
 * an interrupt asserted as a direct result of program execution as opposed
 * to a hardware device asserting an interrupt.
 *
 * When the exception specified by <vector> is asserted, the current thread
 * is saved on the current stack, i.e. a switch to some other stack is not
 * performed, followed by executing <routine> which has the following signature:
 *
 *    void (*routine) (NANO_ESF *pEsf)
 *
 * The <pExcStubMem> argument points to memory that the system can use to
 * synthesize the exception stub that calls <routine>.  The memory need not be
 * initialized, but must be persistent (i.e. it cannot be on the caller's stack).
 * Declaring a global or static variable of type NANO_EXC_STUB will provide a
 * suitable area of the proper size.
 *
 * The handler is connected via an interrupt-gate descriptor having a
 * descriptor privilege level (DPL) equal to zero.

 * INTERNAL
 * The function prototype for nanoCpuExcConnect() only exists in nano_private.h,
 * in other words, it's still considered private since the definitions for
 * the NANO_ESF structures have not been completed.
