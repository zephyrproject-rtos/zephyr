menu "x86 Core Options"
	depends on ARCH="x86"

config NO_ISRS
	bool
	prompt "No Asynchronous Interrupts"
	default n
	help
	This option disables asynchronous interrupts support.

menu "Memory Layout Options"

config IDT_NUM_VECTORS
	int
	prompt "Number of IDT vectors"
	default 256
	help
	This option specifies the number of interrupt vector entries in the
	Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT). By default all 256 vectors are
	supported in an IDT requiring 2048 bytes of memory.

config NUM_GDT_SPARE_ENTRIES
	int
	prompt "Number of spare GDT entries"
	default 0
	help
	This option specifies the number of spare entries in the Global
	Descriptor Table (GDT).

config PHYS_LOAD_ADDR
	hex "Physical load address"
	# Default value must be supplied by BSP
	help
	This option specifies the physical address where the kernel is loaded.

endmenu


menu "Board Capabilities"

config BOI_HANDLER_SUPPORTED
	bool "BOI handler supported"
	default n
	help
	This option signifies that the target has one or more devices whose
	driver utilizes a "beginning of interrupt" handler that gets called
	before the standard interrupt handling code. This capability
	can be used by the driver to suppress spurious interrupts generated
	by the device (or for other purposes).

config EOI_HANDLER_SUPPORTED
	bool "EOI handler supported"
	default n
	help
	This option signifies that the target has one or more devices whose
	driver utilizes an "end of interrupt" handler that gets called
	after the standard interrupt handling code. This capability
	can be used by the driver to tell the device that an interrupt
	has been handled (or for other purposes).


config UNALIGNED_WRITE_UNSUPPORTED
	bool "Unaligned write Supported"
	default n
	help
	This option signifies that the target may not properly decode the
	IA-32 processor's byte enable (BE) lines, resulting in the inability
	to read/write unaligned quantities.

config LOCK_INSTRUCTION_UNSUPPORTED
	bool "Lock Instruction Unsupported"
	default n
	help
	This option signifies that the target lacks support for the IA-32
	LOCK prefix instruction. Code running on such targets cannot
	use the LOCK prefix to perform read-modify-write operations in an
	atomic manner; such targets must utilize other techniques to perform
	atomic operations (such as locking interrupts).

endmenu

menu "Floating Point Options"
	depends on !CPU_FLOAT_UNSUPPORTED

config  FP_SHARING
	bool
	prompt "Floating point resource sharing" if !ENHANCED_SECURITY
	depends on FLOAT
	default n
	select AUTOMATIC_FP_ENABLING if ENHANCED_SECURITY
	help
	This option allows multiple tasks and fibers to safely utilize
	floating point hardware resources. Every task or fiber that wishes
	to use floating point instructions (i.e. x87 FPU, MMX, or SSEx) must
	be created with such support already enabled, or must enable this
	support via task_float_enable() or fiber_float_enable() before
	executing these instructions.

	Enabling this option adds 108 bytes to the stack size requirement
	of each task or fiber that utilizes x87 FPU or MMX instructions,
	and adds 464 bytes to the stack size requirement of each task or
	fiber that utilizes SSEx instructions. (The stack size requirement
	of tasks and fibers that do not utilize floating point instructions
	remains unchanged.)

	Disabling this option means that only a single task or fiber may
	utilize x87 FPU, MMX, or SSEx instructions. (The stack size
	requirement of all tasks and fibers remains unchanged.)

config AUTOMATIC_FP_ENABLING
	bool
	prompt "Automatically enable floating point resource sharing" \
		if !ENHANCED_SECURITY
	depends on FP_SHARING
	default n
	help
	This option allows tasks and fibers to safely utilize floating
	point hardware resources without requiring them to first indicate
	their intention to do so. The system automatically detects when
	a task or fiber that does not currently have floating point support
	enabled uses a floating point instruction, and automatically executes
	task_float_enable() or fiber_float_enable() on its behalf. The
	task or fiber is enabled for using x87 FPU, MMX, or SSEx instructions
	if SSE is configured, otherwise it is enabled for using x87 FPU or
	MMX instructions only.
