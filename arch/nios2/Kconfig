	help
	  Include the reset vector stub, which enables instruction/data caches
	  and then jumps to __start. This code is typically located at the very
	  beginning of flash memory. You may need to omit this if using the
	  nios2-download tool since it refuses to load data anywhere other than
	  RAM.

config EXTRA_EXCEPTION_INFO
	bool "Extra exception debug information"
	help
	  Have exceptions print additional useful debugging information in
	  human-readable form, at the expense of code size. For example,
	  the cause code for an exception will be supplemented by a string
	  describing what that cause code means.

config GP_LOCAL
	bool "Local data global pointer references"
	help
	  Use global pointer relative offsets for small globals declared in the
	  same C file as the code that uses it.

config GP_GLOBAL
	bool "Global data global pointer references"
	help
	  Use global pointer relative offsets for small globals declared
	  anywhere in the executable. Note that if any small globals that are put
	  in alternate sections (such as _k_task_list_ptr) they must be declared
	  in headers with proper __attribute__((section)) or the linker will
	  error out.

config GP_ALL_DATA
	bool "All data global pointer references"
	help
	  Use GP relative access for all data in the program, not just
	  small data. Use this if your board has 64K or less of RAM.
