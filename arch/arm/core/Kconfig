config ISA_THUMB2
	bool
	help
	  From: http://www.arm.com/products/processors/technologies/instruction-set-architectures.php

	  Thumb-2 technology is the instruction set underlying the ARM Cortex
	  architecture which provides enhanced levels of performance, energy
	  efficiency, and code density for a wide range of embedded
	  applications.

	  Thumb-2 technology builds on the success of Thumb, the innovative
	  high code density instruction set for ARM microprocessor cores, to
	  increase the power of the ARM microprocessor core available to
	  developers of low cost, high performance systems.

	  The technology is backwards compatible with existing ARM and Thumb
	  solutions, while significantly extending the features available to
	  the Thumb instructions set. This allows more of the application to
	  benefit from the best in class code density of Thumb.

	  For performance optimized code Thumb-2 technology uses 31 percent
	  less memory to reduce system cost, while providing up to 38 percent
	  higher performance than existing high density code, which can be used
	  to prolong battery-life or to enrich the product feature set. Thumb-2
	  technology is featured in the  processor, and in all ARMv7
	  architecture-based processors.

config ISA_ARM
	bool
	help
	  From: https://developer.arm.com/products/architecture/instruction-sets/a32-and-t32-instruction-sets

	  A32 instructions, known as Arm instructions in pre-Armv8 architectures,
	  are 32 bits wide, and are aligned on 4-byte boundaries. A32 instructions
	  are supported by both A-profile and R-profile architectures.

	  A32 was traditionally used in applications requiring the highest
	  performance, or for handling hardware exceptions such as interrupts and
	  processor start-up. Much of its functionality was subsumed into T32 with
	  the introduction of Thumb-2 technology.

config NUM_IRQS
	int

config STACK_ALIGN_DOUBLE_WORD
	bool "Align stacks on double-words (8 octets)"
	default y
	help
	  This is needed to conform to AAPCS, the procedure call standard for
	  the ARM. It wastes stack space. The option also enforces alignment
	  of stack upon exception entry on Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4 (ARMv7-M).
	  Note that for ARMv6-M, ARMv8-M, and Cortex-M7 MCUs stack alignment
	  on exception entry is enabled by default and it is not configurable.

config RUNTIME_NMI
	bool "Attach an NMI handler at runtime"
	select REBOOT
	help
	  The kernel provides a simple NMI handler that simply hangs in a tight
	  loop if triggered. This fills the requirement that there must be an
	  NMI handler installed when the CPU boots. If a custom handler is
	  needed, enable this option and attach it via _NmiHandlerSet().

config FAULT_DUMP
	int "Fault dump level"
	default 2
	range 0 2
	help
	  Different levels for display information when a fault occurs.

	  2: The default. Display specific and verbose information. Consumes
		the most memory (long strings).

	  1: Display general and short information. Consumes less memory
		(short strings).

	  0: Off.

config BUILTIN_STACK_GUARD
	bool "Thread Stack Guards based on built-in ARM stack limit checking"
	depends on CPU_CORTEX_M_HAS_SPLIM
	select THREAD_STACK_INFO
	help
	  Enable Thread/Interrupt Stack Guards via built-in Stack Pointer
	  limit checking. The functionality must be supported by HW.

config ARM_STACK_PROTECTION
	bool
	default y if HW_STACK_PROTECTION
	imply BUILTIN_STACK_GUARD if CPU_CORTEX_M_HAS_SPLIM
	select MPU_STACK_GUARD if (!BUILTIN_STACK_GUARD && ARM_MPU)
	help
	  This option enables either:
	  - The built-in Stack Pointer limit checking, or
	  - the MPU-based stack guard
	  to cause a system fatal error
	  if the bounds of the current process stack are overflowed.
	  The two stack guard options are mutually exclusive. The
	  selection of the built-in Stack Pointer limit checking is
	  prioritized over the MPU-based stack guard. The developer
	  still has the option to manually select the MPU-based
	  stack guard, if this is desired.

config ARM_SECURE_FIRMWARE
	bool
	depends on ARMV8_M_SE
	default y if TRUSTED_EXECUTION_SECURE
	help
	  This option indicates that we are building a Zephyr image that
	  is intended to execute in Secure state. The option is only
	  applicable to ARMv8-M MCUs that implement the Security Extension.

	  This option enables Zephyr to include code that executes in
	  Secure state, as well as to exclude code that is designed to
	  execute only in Non-secure state.

	  Code executing in Secure state has access to both the Secure
	  and Non-Secure resources of the Cortex-M MCU.

	  Code executing in Non-Secure state may trigger Secure Faults,
	  if Secure MCU resources are accessed from the Non-Secure state.
	  Secure Faults may only be handled by code executing in Secure
	  state.

config ARM_NONSECURE_FIRMWARE
	bool
	depends on !ARM_SECURE_FIRMWARE
	depends on ARMV8_M_SE
	default y if TRUSTED_EXECUTION_NONSECURE
	help
	  This option indicates that we are building a Zephyr image that
	  is intended to execute in Non-Secure state. Execution of this
	  image is triggered by Secure firmware that executes in Secure
	  state. The option is only applicable to ARMv8-M MCUs that
	  implement the Security Extension.

	  This option enables Zephyr to include code that executes in
	  Non-Secure state only, as well as to exclude code that is
	  designed to execute only in Secure state.

	  Code executing in Non-Secure state has no access to Secure
	  resources of the Cortex-M MCU, and, therefore, it shall avoid
	  accessing them.

	  Notes:
	  - The default value (i.e. when the user does not configure
	  the option explicitly) instructs the linker script to
	  place the Non-Secure Callable section, automatically,
	  inside the .text area.
	  - Certain requirements/restrictions may apply regarding
	  the size and the alignment of the starting address for
	  a Non-Secure Callable section, depending on the available
	  security attribution unit (SAU or IDAU) for a given SOC.

config ARM_FIRMWARE_USES_SECURE_ENTRY_FUNCS
