config CPU_CORTEX
	bool
	# Omit prompt to signify "hidden" option
	default n
	help
	  This option signifies the use of a CPU of the Cortex family.

config CPU_CORTEX_M
	bool
	# Omit prompt to signify "hidden" option
	default n
	select CPU_CORTEX
	select ARCH_HAS_CUSTOM_SWAP_TO_MAIN
	select HAS_CMSIS
	select HAS_FLASH_LOAD_OFFSET
	select HAS_DTS
	select ARCH_HAS_STACK_PROTECTION if ARM_CORE_MPU
	select ARCH_HAS_USERSPACE if ARM_CORE_MPU
	help
	  This option signifies the use of a CPU of the Cortex-M family.

config CPU_HAS_SYSTICK
	bool
	# Omit prompt to signify "hidden" option
	default n
	help
	  This option is enabled when the CPU has systick timer implemented.

config BUILTIN_STACK_GUARD
	bool "Thread Stack Guards based on built-in ARM stack limit checking"
	depends on CPU_CORTEX_M_HAS_SPLIM
	select THREAD_STACK_INFO
	default n
	help
	  Enable Thread/Interrupt Stack Guards via built-in Stack Pointer
	  limit checking. The functionality must be supported by HW.

config ARM_STACK_PROTECTION
	bool
	default y if HW_STACK_PROTECTION
	select BUILTIN_STACK_GUARD if CPU_CORTEX_M_HAS_SPLIM
	select MPU_STACK_GUARD if (!BUILTIN_STACK_GUARD && ARM_CORE_MPU)
	help
	  This option enables either:
	  - The built-in Stack Pointer limit checking, or
	  - the MPU-based stack guard
	  to cause a system fatal error
	  if the bounds of the current process stack are overflowed.
	  The two stack guard options are mutually exclusive. The
	  selection of the built-in Stack Pointer limit checking is
	  prioritized over the MPU-based stack guard.

config ARM_SECURE_FIRMWARE
	bool
	default n
	help
	  This option enables Zephyr to include code that executes in
	  Secure state, as well as to exclude code that is designed to
	  execute only in Non-secure state. The option is only applicable
	  to ARMv8-M MCUs that implement the Security Extension.

	  Code executing in Secure state has access to both the Secure
	  and Non-Secure resources of the Cortex-M MCU.

	  Code executing in Non-Secure state may trigger Secure Faults,
	  if Secure MCU resources are accessed from the Non-Secure state.
	  Secure Faults may only be handled by code executing in Secure
	  state.

config FP_HARDABI
	bool "Floating point Hard ABI"
	depends on FLOAT
	help
	  This option selects the Floating point ABI in which hardware floating
	  point instructions are generated and uses FPU-specific calling
	  conventions

config FP_SOFTABI
	bool "Floating point Soft ABI"
	depends on FLOAT
	help
	  This option selects the Floating point ABI in which hardware floating
	  point instructions are generated but soft-float calling conventions.
