config CPU_CORTEX_M3_M4
	bool
	# Omit prompt to signify "hidden" option
	default n
	select ISA_THUMB2
	help
	This option signifies the use of either a Cortex-M3 or Cortex-M4 CPU.

config CPU_CORTEX_M3
	bool
	# Omit prompt to signify "hidden" option
	select CPU_CORTEX_M3_M4
	help
	This option signifies the use of a Cortex-M3 CPU

config CPU_CORTEX_M4
	bool
	# Omit prompt to signify "hidden" option
	select CPU_CORTEX_M3_M4
	help
	This option signifies the use of a Cortex-M4 CPU

config LDREX_STREX_AVAILABLE
	bool
	default y

config DATA_ENDIANNESS_LITTLE
	bool
	default y
	help
	This is driven by the processor implementation, since it is fixed in
	hardware. The platform should set this value to 'n' if the data is
	implemented as big endian.

config STACK_ALIGN_DOUBLE_WORD
	bool
	prompt "Align stacks on double-words (8 octets)"
	default y
	help
	This is needed to conform to AAPCS, the procedure call standard for
	the ARM. It wastes stack space.


config STACK_GROWS_DOWN
	bool
	prompt "Stacks grow down"
	default y
	help
	Stacks can grow either up or down. Down is the default. Don't change
	this unless you have a very good reason to do so.

config NUM_IRQ_PRIO_BITS
	int
	#hidden option, implemented by platform
	help
	Cortex-M chips can implement up to 8 bits of interrupt priorities,
	for a maximum of 256 priorities. Most chips implement fewer than 8.

	The platform must define the correct value.

config RUNTIME_NMI
	bool
	prompt "Attach an NMI handler at runtime"
	default n
	help
	The kernel provides a simple NMI handler that simply hangs in a tight
	loop if triggered. This fills the requirement that there must be an
	NMI handler installed when the CPU boots. If a custom handler is
	needed, enable this option and attach it via _NmiHandlerSet().

config FAULT_DUMP
	int
	prompt "Fault dump level"
	default 2
	help
	Different levels for display information when a fault occurs.

	2: The default. Display specific and verbose information. Consumes
		the most memory (long strings).
	1: Display general and short information. Consumes less memory
		(short strings).
	0: Off.

config XIP
	default y

config SRAM_SIZE
	int "SRAM Size in kB"
	default 192
	help
	This option specifies the size of the SRAM in kB.  It is normally set by
	the platform's defconfig file and the user should generally avoid modifying
	it via the menu configuration.

config SRAM_BASE_ADDRESS
	hex "SRAM Base Address"
	default 0x20000000
	help
	This option specifies the base address of the SRAM on the platform.  It is
	normally set by the platform's defconfig file and the user should generally
	avoid modifying it via the menu configuration.

config FLASH_SIZE
	int "Flash Size in kB"
	default 1024
	help
	This option specifies the size of the flash in kB.  It is normally set by
	the platform's defconfig file and the user should generally avoid modifying
	it via the menu configuration.

config FLASH_BASE_ADDRESS
	hex "Flash Base Address"
	default 0x00000000
	help
	This option specifies the base address of the flash on the platform.  It is
	normally set by the platform's defconfig file and the user should generally
	avoid modifying it via the menu configuration.

config SW_ISR_TABLE
	bool
	prompt "Enable software interrupt handler table"
	default y
	help
	Enable an interrupt handler table implemented in software. This
	table, unlike ISRs connected directly in the vector table, allow
	a parameter to be passed to the interrupt handlers. Also, invoking
	the exeception/interrupt exit stub is automatically done.

	This has to be enabled for dynamically connecting interrupt handlers
	at runtime (SW_ISR_TABLE_DYNAMIC).

config SW_ISR_TABLE_DYNAMIC
	bool
	prompt "Allow installing interrupt handlers at runtime"
	depends on SW_ISR_TABLE
	default y
	help
	This option enables irq_connect(). It moves the ISR table to
	SRAM so that it is writable. This has the side-effect of removing
	write-protection on the ISR table.

config SW_ISR_TABLE_STATIC_CUSTOM
	bool
	prompt "Projects provide a custom static software ISR table"
	depends on SW_ISR_TABLE && !SW_ISR_TABLE_DYNAMIC
	default n
	help
	Projects, not the platform, provide a software table of ISR and their
	parameters. The table is static, and thus ISRs cannot be connected
	at runtime.

config IRQ_VECTOR_TABLE_CUSTOM
	bool
	prompt "Projects provide a custom static IRQ part of vector table"
	depends on !SW_ISR_TABLE
	default n
	help
	Projects, not the platform, provide the IRQ part of the vector table.

	This is the table of interrupt handlers with the best potential
	performance, but is the less flexible.

	The ISRs are installed directly in the vector table, thus are
	directly called by the CPU when an interrupt is taken. This adds
	the least overhead when handling an interrupt.

	Downsides:
	- ISRs cannot have a parameter
	- ISRs cannot be connected at runtime
	- ISRs must notify the kernel manually by invoking _IntExit() when
		then are about to return.

config IRQ_VECTOR_TABLE_PLATFORM
	bool
	# omit prompt to signify a "hidden" option
	depends on SW_ISR_TABLE || !IRQ_VECTOR_TABLE_CUSTOM
	default y
	help
	Not user-selectable, helps build system logic.

config ZERO_LATENCY_IRQS
	bool
	prompt "Enable zero-latency interrupts"
	default n
	help
	Interrupt locking is done by setting exception masking to priority
	one, thus allowing exception of priority zero to still come in. By
	default, the kernel verifies, via __ASSERT() statements, that the
	interrupt priority is not set to zero when either connecting them or
	setting their priority. Enabling this option disables the check,
	thus allowing setting the priority of interrupts to zero.

	Note that this is a somewhat dangerous option: ISRs of priority zero
	interrupts cannot use any kernel functionality.

config ARCH_HAS_TASK_ABORT
	bool
	# omit prompt to signify a "hidden" option
	default y

config ARCH_HAS_NANO_FIBER_ABORT
	bool
	# omit prompt to signify a "hidden" option
	default y
