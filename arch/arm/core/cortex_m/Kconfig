config CPU_CORTEX_M_HAS_BASEPRI
	bool
	depends on ARMV7_M_ARMV8_M_MAINLINE
	help
	  This option signifies the CPU has the BASEPRI register.

	  The BASEPRI register defines the minimum priority for
	  exception processing. When BASEPRI is set to a nonzero

	  the same or lower priority level as the BASEPRI value.
	  Always present in CPUs that implement the ARMv7-M or
	  ARM8-M Mainline architectures.

	  can descend. MSPLIM, PSPLIM are always present in ARMv8-M
	  MCUs that implement the ARMv8-M Main Extension (Mainline).

	  In an ARMv8-M Mainline implementation with the Security Extension
	  the MSPLIM, PSPLIM registers have additional Secure instances.
  	  In an ARMv8-M Baseline implementation with the Security Extension
	  the MSPLIM, PSPLIM registers have only Secure instances.

	  implementation, or the use of an ARMv8-M processor
	  supporting the Baseline implementation.

	  Notes:
	  - A Processing Element (PE) without the Main Extension
	  is also referred to as a Baseline Implementation. A
	  Baseline implementation has a subset of the instructions,
	  registers, and features, of a Mainline implementation.
	  - ARMv6-M compatibility is provided by all ARMv8-M
	  implementations.

config ARMV8_M_BASELINE
	bool
	select ARMV6_M_ARMV8_M_BASELINE
	select CPU_CORTEX_M_HAS_CMSE

	  ARMv8-M processor implementation supporting the Main
	  Extension.

	  Notes:
	  - A Processing Element (PE) with the Main Extension is also
	  referred to as a Mainline Implementation.

	help
	  The kernel may reserve some of the highest interrupts priorities in
	  the system for its own use. These interrupts will not be masked
	  by interrupt locking.
	  When connecting interrupts the kernel will offset all interrupts
	  to lower priority than those reserved by the kernel.
	  Zero-latency interrupt can be used to set up an interrupt at the
	  highest interrupt priority which will not be blocked by interrupt
	  locking.
	  Since Zero-latency ISRs will run in the same priority or possibly at
	  higher priority than the rest of the kernel they cannot use any
	  kernel functionality.
