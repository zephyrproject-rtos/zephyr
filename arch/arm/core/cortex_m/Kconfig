	  Thumb-2 technology is the instruction set underlying the ARM Cortex
	  architecture which provides enhanced levels of performance, energy
	  efficiency, and code density for a wide range of embedded
	  applications.

	  Thumb-2 technology builds on the success of Thumb, the innovative
	  high code density instruction set for ARM microprocessor cores, to
	  increase the power of the ARM microprocessor core available to
	  developers of low cost, high performance systems.

	  The technology is backwards compatible with existing ARM and Thumb
	  solutions, while significantly extending the features available to
	  the Thumb instructions set. This allows more of the application to
	  benefit from the best in class code density of Thumb.

	  For performance optimized code Thumb-2 technology uses 31 percent
	  less memory to reduce system cost, while providing up to 38 percent
	  higher performance than existing high density code, which can be used
	  to prolong battery-life or to enrich the product feature set. Thumb-2
	  technology is featured in the  processor, and in all ARMv7
	  architecture-based processors.

config CPU_CORTEX_M_HAS_BASEPRI
	bool
	# Omit prompt to signify "hidden" option
	default n
	help
	  This option signifies the CPU has the BASEPRI register.

config CPU_CORTEX_M_HAS_VTOR
	bool
	# Omit prompt to signify "hidden" option
	default n
	help
	  This option signifies the CPU has the VTOR register.

config CPU_CORTEX_M_HAS_SPLIM
	bool
	# Omit prompt to signify "hidden" option
	depends on ARMV8_M_MAINLINE
	default n
	help
	  This option signifies the CPU has the MSPLIM, PSPLIM registers.

	  The stack pointer limit registers, MSPLIM, PSPLIM, limit the
	  extend to which the Main and Process Stack Pointers, respectively,
	  can descend. MSPLIM, PSPLIM are always present in ARMv8-M
	  MCUs that implement the ARMv8-M Main Extension (Mainline).

	  In an ARMv8-M implementation with the Security Extension, the
	  MSPLIM, PSPLIM registers have additional Secure instances.

config CPU_CORTEX_M_HAS_PROGRAMMABLE_FAULT_PRIOS
	bool
	# Omit prompt to signify "hidden" option
	depends on ARMV7_M_ARMV8_M_MAINLINE
	default n
	help
	  This option signifies the CPU may trigger system faults
	  (other than HardFault) with configurable priority, and,
	  therefore, it needs to reserve a priority level for them.

config CPU_CORTEX_M0_HAS_VECTOR_TABLE_REMAP
	bool
	# Omit prompt to signify "hidden" option
	default n
	help
	  This option signifies the Cortex-M0 has some mechanisms that can map
	  the vector table to SRAM

	bool
	# Omit prompt to signify "hidden" option
	default n
	select ATOMIC_OPERATIONS_C
	select ISA_THUMB2
	help
	  This option signifies the use of an ARMv6-M processor
	  implementation, or the use of an ARMv8-M processor
	  supporting the Baseline implementation.

	  Notes:
	  - A Processing Element (PE) without the Main Extension
	  is also referred to as a Baseline Implementation. A
	  Baseline implementation has a subset of the instructions,
	  registers, and features, of a Mainline implementation.
	  - ARMv6-M compatibility is provided by all ARMv8-M
	  implementations.

	  This option signifies the use of an ARMv7-M processor
	  implementation, or the use of an ARMv8-M processor
	  implementation supporting the Main Extension.

	  Notes:
	  - A Processing Element (PE) with the Main Extension is also
	  referred to as a Mainline Implementation.
	  - ARMv7-M compatibility requires the Main Extension.

	  From https://developer.arm.com/products/architecture/m-profile:
	  The Main Extension provides backwards compatibility
	  with ARMv7-M.

	bool

config DATA_ENDIANNESS_LITTLE
	bool
	default y
	help
	  This is driven by the processor implementation, since it is fixed in
	  hardware. The board should set this value to 'n' if the data is
	  implemented as big endian.

config STACK_ALIGN_DOUBLE_WORD
	bool
	prompt "Align stacks on double-words (8 octets)"

	  This is needed to conform to AAPCS, the procedure call standard for

config RUNTIME_NMI
	bool
	prompt "Attach an NMI handler at runtime"
	select REBOOT
	default n
	help
	  The kernel provides a simple NMI handler that simply hangs in a tight
	  loop if triggered. This fills the requirement that there must be an
	  NMI handler installed when the CPU boots. If a custom handler is
	  needed, enable this option and attach it via _NmiHandlerSet().

config ZERO_LATENCY_IRQS

	help
	  Interrupt locking is done by setting exception masking to priority
	  one, thus allowing exception of priority zero to still come in. By
	  default, the kernel verifies, via __ASSERT() statements, that the
	  interrupt priority is not set to zero when either connecting them or
	  setting their priority. Enabling this option disables the check,
	  thus allowing setting the priority of interrupts to zero.

	  Note that this is a somewhat dangerous option: ISRs of priority zero
	  interrupts cannot use any kernel functionality.

	  Add Vector Table relay handler and relay vector table, to
	  relay interrupts based on a vector table pointer. This is only
