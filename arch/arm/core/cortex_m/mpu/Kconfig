	  MCU implements Memory Protection Unit.
	  Note that NXP MPU as well as ARMv8-M MPU does not require MPU regions
	  to have power-of-two alignment for base address and region size.
	  In addition to the above, ARMv8-M MPU requires the active MPU regions
	  be non-overlapping.

	  Minimum size (and alignment) of an ARM MPU region. Use this

	  Minimum size (and alignment when applicable) of an ARM MPU
	  region, which guards the stack of a thread that is using the
	  Floating Point (FP) context. The width of the guard is set to
	  128, to accommodate the length of a Cortex-M exception stack
	  frame when the floating point context is active. The FP context
	  is only stacked in sharing FP registers mode, therefore, the
	  option is applicable only when FP_SHARING is selected.

	  wasting in linker scripts defined memory sections. Use this symbol
	  to guarantee user custom section align size to avoid more memory used
	  for respect alignment. But that needs carefully configure MPU region
	  and sub-regions(ARMv7-M) to cover this feature.

config CUSTOM_SECTION_MIN_ALIGN_SIZE
	int "Custom Section Align Size"

	help
	  Custom align size of memory section in linker scripts. Usually
	  it should consume less alignment memory. Although this alignment
	  size is configured by users, it must also respect the power of
	  two regulation if hardware requires.
