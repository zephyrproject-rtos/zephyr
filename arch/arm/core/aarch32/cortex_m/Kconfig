	depends on !CPU_CORTEX_M0 && !CPU_CORTEX_M0PLUS && !CPU_CORTEX_M1
	help
	  This option signifies that the CPU implements the Data Watchpoint and
	  Trace (DWT) unit specified by the ARMv7-M and above.

	  While ARMv6-M does define a "DWT" unit, this is significantly different
	  from the DWT specified by the ARMv7-M and above in terms of both feature
	  set and register mappings.

config CPU_CORTEX_M_HAS_BASEPRI
	bool
	depends on ARMV7_M_ARMV8_M_MAINLINE
	help
	  This option signifies the CPU has the BASEPRI register.

	  The BASEPRI register defines the minimum priority for
	  exception processing. When BASEPRI is set to a nonzero
	  value, it prevents the activation of all exceptions with
	  the same or lower priority level as the BASEPRI value.
	  Always present in CPUs that implement the ARMv7-M or
	  ARM8-M Mainline architectures.

	  address from memory address 0x00000000. Always present
	  in CPUs implementing the ARMv7-M or ARMv8-M architectures.
	  Optional in CPUs implementing ARMv6-M, ARMv8-M Baseline
	  architectures (except for Cortex-M0/M1, where it is never

config CPU_CORTEX_M_HAS_SPLIM
	bool
	depends on ARMV8_M_MAINLINE || (ARMV8_M_SE && !ARM_NONSECURE_FIRMWARE)

	  The stack pointer limit registers, MSPLIM, PSPLIM, limit the
	  extend to which the Main and Process Stack Pointers, respectively,
	  can descend. MSPLIM, PSPLIM are always present in ARMv8-M
	  MCUs that implement the ARMv8-M Main Extension (Mainline).

	  In an ARMv8-M Mainline implementation with the Security Extension
	  the MSPLIM, PSPLIM registers have additional Secure instances.
	  In an ARMv8-M Baseline implementation with the Security Extension
	  the MSPLIM, PSPLIM registers have only Secure instances.

config CPU_CORTEX_M_HAS_PROGRAMMABLE_FAULT_PRIOS
	bool
	depends on ARMV7_M_ARMV8_M_MAINLINE
	help
	  This option signifies the CPU may trigger system faults
	  (other than HardFault) with configurable priority, and,
	  therefore, it needs to reserve a priority level for them.

config CPU_CORTEX_M0_HAS_VECTOR_TABLE_REMAP
	bool
	depends on ARMV6_M_ARMV8_M_BASELINE
	help
	  This option signifies the Cortex-M0 has some mechanisms that can map

config ARMV6_M_ARMV8_M_BASELINE
	bool
	select ATOMIC_OPERATIONS_C
	select ISA_THUMB2
	help
	  This option signifies the use of an ARMv6-M processor
	  implementation, or the use of an ARMv8-M processor
	  supporting the Baseline implementation.

	  Notes:
	  - A Processing Element (PE) without the Main Extension
	  is also referred to as a Baseline Implementation. A
	  Baseline implementation has a subset of the instructions,
	  registers, and features, of a Mainline implementation.
	  - ARMv6-M compatibility is provided by all ARMv8-M
	  implementations.

config ARMV8_M_BASELINE
	bool
	select ARMV6_M_ARMV8_M_BASELINE
	select CPU_CORTEX_M_HAS_CMSE

	help
	  This option signifies the use of an ARMv7-M processor
	  implementation, or the use of a backwards-compatible
	  ARMv8-M processor implementation supporting the Main
	  Extension.

	  Notes:
	  - A Processing Element (PE) with the Main Extension is also
	  referred to as a Mainline Implementation.
	  - ARMv7-M compatibility requires the Main Extension.

	  From https://developer.arm.com/products/architecture/m-profile:
	  The Main Extension provides backwards compatibility
	  with ARMv7-M.

config ARMV8_M_MAINLINE
	bool

config ZERO_LATENCY_IRQS
	bool "Enable zero-latency interrupts"
	depends on CPU_CORTEX_M_HAS_BASEPRI
	help
	  The kernel may reserve some of the highest interrupts priorities in
	  the system for its own use. These interrupts will not be masked
	  by interrupt locking.
	  When connecting interrupts the kernel will offset all interrupts
	  to lower priority than those reserved by the kernel.
	  Zero-latency interrupt can be used to set up an interrupt at the
	  highest interrupt priority which will not be blocked by interrupt
	  locking.
	  Since Zero-latency ISRs will run in the same priority or possibly at
	  higher priority than the rest of the kernel they cannot use any
	  kernel functionality.

config DYNAMIC_DIRECT_INTERRUPTS
	bool "Enable support for dynamic direct interrupts"
	depends on DYNAMIC_INTERRUPTS
	help
	  Direct interrupts are designed for performance-critical interrupt
	  handling and do not go through all of the common interrupt handling
	  code. This option enables the installation of interrupt service
	  routines for direct interrupts at runtime.
	  Note: this requires enabling support for dynamic interrupts in the
	  kernel.

config SW_VECTOR_RELAY
	bool "Enable Software Vector Relay"
	help
	  When building a bootloader firmware this option adds a
	  vector table relay handler and a vector relay table, to
	  relay interrupts based on a vector table pointer.
	  This is only required but not limited to Cortex-M Baseline CPUs
	  with no hardware vector table relocation mechanisms (e.g. VTOR).

config SW_VECTOR_RELAY_CLIENT
	bool "Enable Software Vector Relay (client)"
	default y if BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT && !CPU_CORTEX_M0_HAS_VECTOR_TABLE_REMAP
	depends on !CPU_CORTEX_M_HAS_VTOR
	help
	  Another image has enabled SW_VECTOR_RELAY, and will be forwarding
	  exceptions and HW interrupts to this image. Enable this option to make
	  sure the vector table pointer in RAM is set properly by the image upon
	  initialization.

config CORTEX_M_DWT
	bool "Enable and use the DWT"
	depends on CPU_CORTEX_M_HAS_DWT
	default y if TIMING_FUNCTIONS
