config SOC_ATMEL_SAM3_EXT_SLCK
	bool "Atmel SAM3 to use external crystal oscillator for slow clock"
	default n
	help
	Says y if you want to use external 32 kHz crystal
	oscillator to drive the slow clock. Note that this
	adds a few seconds to boot time, as the crystal
	needs to stabilize after power-up.

	Says n if you do not need accraute and precise timers.
	The slow clock will be driven by the internal fast
	RC oscillator running at 32 kHz.

config SOC_ATMEL_SAM3_EXT_MAINCK
	bool "Atmel SAM3 to use external crystal oscillator for main clock"
	default n
	help
	The main clock is being used to drive the PLL, and
	thus driving the processor clock.

	Says y if you want to use external crystal oscillator
	to drive the main clock. Note that this adds about
	a second to boot time, as the crystal needs to
	stabilize after power-up.

	The crystal used here can be from 3 to 20 MHz.

	Says n here will use the internal fast RC oscillator
	running at 12 MHz.

config SOC_ATMEL_SAM3_PLLA_MULA
	hex
	default 0x06
	help
	This is the multiplier (MULA) used by the PLL.
	The processor clock is (MAINCK * (MULA + 1) / DIVA).

	Board config file can override this settings
	for a particular board.

	With default of MULA == 6, and DIVA == 1,
	PLL is running at 7 times of main clock.

config SOC_ATMEL_SAM3_PLLA_DIVA
	hex
	default 0x01
	help
	This is the divider (DIVA) used by the PLL.
	The processor clock is (MAINCK * (MULA + 1) / DIVA).

	Board config file can override this settings
	for a particular board.

	With default of MULA == 6, and DIVA == 1,
	PLL is running at 7 times of main clock.
