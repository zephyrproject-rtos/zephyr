config CPU_CORTEX
	bool
	help
	  This option signifies the use of a CPU of the Cortex family.

config ARM_CUSTOM_INTERRUPT_CONTROLLER
	bool
	depends on !CPU_CORTEX_M
	help
	  This option indicates that the ARM CPU is connected to a custom (i.e.
	  non-GIC) interrupt controller.

	  A number of Cortex-A and Cortex-R cores (Cortex-A5, Cortex-R4/5, ...)
	  allow interfacing to a custom external interrupt controller and this
	  option must be selected when such cores are connected to an interrupt
	  controller that is not the ARM Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC).

	  When this option is selected, the architecture interrupt control
	  functions are mapped to the SoC interrupt control interface, which is
	  implemented at the SoC level.

	  N.B. This option is only applicable to the Cortex-A and Cortex-R
	       family cores. The Cortex-M family cores are always equipped with
	       the ARM Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC).

config HAS_ARM_SMCCC
	bool
	help
	  Include support for the Secure Monitor Call (SMC) and Hypervisor
	  Call (HVC) instructions on Armv7 and above architectures.
