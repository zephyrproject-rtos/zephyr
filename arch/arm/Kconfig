config CPU_CORTEX
	bool
	help
	  This option signifies the use of a CPU of the Cortex family.

config ARM_CUSTOM_INTERRUPT_CONTROLLER
	bool
	depends on !CPU_CORTEX_M
	help
	  This option indicates that the ARM CPU is connected to a custom (i.e.
	  non-GIC) interrupt controller.

	  A number of Cortex-A and Cortex-R cores (Cortex-A5, Cortex-R4/5, ...)
	  allow interfacing to a custom external interrupt controller and this
	  option must be selected when such cores are connected to an interrupt
	  controller that is not the ARM Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC).

	  When this option is selected, the architecture interrupt control
	  functions are mapped to the SoC interrupt control interface, which is
	  implemented at the SoC level.

	  N.B. This option is only applicable to the Cortex-A and Cortex-R
	       family cores. The Cortex-M family cores are always equipped with
	       the ARM Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC).

config CODE_DATA_RELOCATION_SRAM
	bool "Relocate code/data sections to SRAM"
	depends on CPU_CORTEX_M
	select CODE_DATA_RELOCATION
	help
	  When selected this will relocate .text, data and .bss sections from
	  the specified files and places it in SRAM. The files should be specified
	  in the CMakeList.txt file with a cmake API zephyr_code_relocate(). This
	  config is used to create an MPU entry for the SRAM space used for code
	  relocation.

config ARM_ON_ENTER_CPU_IDLE_HOOK
	bool
	help
	  Enables a hook (z_arm_on_enter_cpu_idle()) that is called when
	  the CPU is made idle (by k_cpu_idle() or k_cpu_atomic_idle()).
	  If needed, this hook can be used to prevent the CPU from actually
	  entering sleep by skipping the WFE/WFI instruction.

config ARM_ON_ENTER_CPU_IDLE_PREPARE_HOOK
	bool
	help
	  Enables a hook (z_arm_on_enter_cpu_idle_prepare()) that is called when
	  the CPU is made idle (by k_cpu_idle() or k_cpu_atomic_idle()).
	  If needed, this hook can prepare data to upcoming call to
	  z_arm_on_enter_cpu_idle(). The z_arm_on_enter_cpu_idle_prepare differs
	  from z_arm_on_enter_cpu_idle because it is called before interrupts are
	  disabled.

config ARM_ON_EXIT_CPU_IDLE
	bool
	help
	  Enables a possibility to inject SoC-specific code just after WFI/WFE
	  instructions of the cpu idle implementation.

	  Enabling this option requires that the SoC provides a soc_cpu_idle.h
	  header file which defines SOC_ON_EXIT_CPU_IDLE macro guarded by
	  _ASMLANGUAGE.

	  The SOC_ON_EXIT_CPU_IDLE macro is expanded just after
	  WFI/WFE instructions before any memory access is performed. The purpose
	  of the SOC_ON_EXIT_CPU_IDLE is to perform an action that mitigate issues
	  observed on some SoCs caused by a memory access following WFI/WFE
	  instructions.
