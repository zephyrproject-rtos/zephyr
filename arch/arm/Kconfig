config CPU_CORTEX
	bool
	help
	  This option signifies the use of a CPU of the Cortex family.

config ARM_CUSTOM_INTERRUPT_CONTROLLER
	bool
	help
	  This option indicates that the ARM CPU is connected to a custom (i.e.
	  non-GIC or NVIC) interrupt controller.

	  A number of Cortex-A and Cortex-R cores (Cortex-A5, Cortex-R4/5, ...)
	  allow interfacing to a custom external interrupt controller and this
	  option must be selected when such cores are connected to an interrupt
	  controller that is not the ARM Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC) or
	  the Cortex-M ARM Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC).

	  When this option is selected, the architecture interrupt control
	  functions are mapped to the SoC interrupt control interface, which is
	  implemented at the SoC level.

	  N.B. Since all Cortex-M cores have a NVIC, if this option is selected it
	  is assumed that the custom interrupt control interface implementation
	  assumes responsibility for handling the NVIC.

config ROMSTART_RELOCATION_ROM
	bool "Relocate rom_start region"
	default n
	help
	  Relocates the rom_start region containing the boot-vector data and
	  irq vectors to the region specified by configurations:
	  ROMSTART_REGION_ADDRESS and ROMSTART_REGION_SIZE

	  This is useful for the Linux Remoteproc framework that uses the elf-loader
	  such that it is able to load the correct boot-vector (contained in rom_start)
	  into the correct memory location independent of the chosen zephyr,flash
	  ROM region.

	  Most SOCs include an alias for the boot-vector at address 0x00000000
	  so a default which might be supported by the corresponding Linux rproc driver.
	  If it is not, additionnal options allows to specify the addresses.

	  In general this option should be chosen if the zephyr,flash chosen node
	  is not placed into the boot-vector memory area.

	  While this aims at generating a correct zephyr.elf file, it has the side
	  effect of enlarging the bin file. If the zephyr.bin file is used to boot the
	  secondary core, this option should be disabled.

	  Example:
		on IMX7D, the chosen zephyr,flash can be OCRAM/OCRAM_S/TCM/DDR memories
		for code location. But the boot-vector must be placed into OCRAM_S for the
		CORTEX-M to boot (alias 0, real 0x00180000/32K available).

if ROMSTART_RELOCATION_ROM

	config ROMSTART_REGION_ADDRESS
		hex "Base address of the rom_start region"
		default 0x00000000
		help
		  Start address of the rom_start region.
		  This setting can be derived from a DT node reg property or specified directly.

		  A default value of 0x00000000 might work in most cases as SOCs have an alias
		  to the right memory region of the boot-vector.

		  Examples:
		  -IMX7D the boot-vector is OCRAM_S (0x00180000, aliased at 0x0).
		  -IMX6SX the boot-vector is TCML (0x007F8000, aliased at 0x0).
		  -IMX8MQ the boot-vector is TCML (0x007E0000, aliased at 0x0).
		  -IMX8MN the boot-vector is ITCM (0x007E0000, aliased at 0x0).

		  Example of DT definition:
		  $(dt_nodelabel_reg_addr_hex,ocram_s_sys)

	config ROMSTART_REGION_SIZE
		hex "Size of the rom_start region"
		default 1
		help
		  Size of the rom_start region in KB.

		  Default is 1KB which is enough to store the boot and irq vectors.

		  This setting can be derived from a DT node reg property or specified directly.

		  Example for IMX7D that needs the boot-vector into OCRAM_S (0x00180000):
		  $(dt_nodelabel_reg_size_hex,ocram_s_sys,0,K)

config CODE_DATA_RELOCATION_SRAM
	bool "Relocate code/data sections to SRAM"
	depends on CPU_CORTEX_M
	select CODE_DATA_RELOCATION
	help
	  When selected this will relocate .text, data and .bss sections from
	  the specified files and places it in SRAM. The files should be specified
	  in the CMakeList.txt file with a cmake API zephyr_code_relocate(). This
	  config is used to create an MPU entry for the SRAM space used for code
	  relocation.

config ARM_ON_ENTER_CPU_IDLE_HOOK
	bool
	help
	  Enables a hook (z_arm_on_enter_cpu_idle()) that is called when
	  the CPU is made idle (by k_cpu_idle() or k_cpu_atomic_idle()).
	  If needed, this hook can be used to prevent the CPU from actually
	  entering sleep by skipping the WFE/WFI instruction.

config ARM_ON_ENTER_CPU_IDLE_PREPARE_HOOK
	bool
	help
	  Enables a hook (z_arm_on_enter_cpu_idle_prepare()) that is called when
	  the CPU is made idle (by k_cpu_idle() or k_cpu_atomic_idle()).
	  If needed, this hook can prepare data to upcoming call to
	  z_arm_on_enter_cpu_idle(). The z_arm_on_enter_cpu_idle_prepare differs
	  from z_arm_on_enter_cpu_idle because it is called before interrupts are
	  disabled.

config ARM_ON_EXIT_CPU_IDLE
	bool
	help
	  Enables a possibility to inject SoC-specific code just after WFI/WFE
	  instructions of the cpu idle implementation.

	  Enabling this option requires that the SoC provides a soc_cpu_idle.h
	  header file which defines SOC_ON_EXIT_CPU_IDLE macro guarded by
	  _ASMLANGUAGE.

	  The SOC_ON_EXIT_CPU_IDLE macro is expanded just after
	  WFI/WFE instructions before any memory access is performed. The purpose
	  of the SOC_ON_EXIT_CPU_IDLE is to perform an action that mitigate issues
	  observed on some SoCs caused by a memory access following WFI/WFE
	  instructions.

# General options signifying CPU capabilities of ARM SoCs
config CPU_HAS_ARM_MPU
	bool
	select CPU_HAS_MPU
	help
	  This option is enabled when the CPU has a Memory Protection Unit (MPU)
	  in ARM flavor.

config CPU_HAS_NXP_MPU
	bool
	select CPU_HAS_MPU
	help
	  This option is enabled when the CPU has a Memory Protection Unit (MPU)
	  in NXP flavor.

config CPU_HAS_CUSTOM_FIXED_SOC_MPU_REGIONS
	bool "Custom fixed SoC MPU region definition"
	help
	  If enabled, this option signifies that the SoC will
	  define and configure its own fixed MPU regions in the
	  SoC definition. These fixed MPU regions are currently
	  used to set Flash and SRAM default access policies and
	  they are programmed at boot time.

	help
	  MCU implements the ARM Security Attribution Unit (SAU).

config CPU_HAS_NRF_IDAU
	bool
	select CPU_HAS_TEE
	help
	  MCU implements the nRF (vendor-specific) Security Attribution Unit.
	  (IDAU: "Implementation-Defined Attribution Unit", in accordance with
	  ARM terminology).

config HAS_SWO
	bool
	help
	  When enabled, indicates that SoC has an SWO output
