config SOC
	string
	help
	SoC name which can be found under arch/<arch>/soc/<soc name>.
	This option holds the directory name used by the build system to locate
	the correct linker and header files for the SoC. This option will go away
	once all SoCs are using family/series structure.

config SOC_SERIES
	string
	help
	SoC series name which can be found under arch/<arch>/soc/<family>/<series>.
	This option holds the directory name used by the build system to locate
	the correct linker and header files.

	string
	help
	SoC family name which can be found under arch/<arch>/soc/<family>.
	This option holds the directory name used by the build system to locate
	the correct linker and header files.

config BOARD
	string
	help
	This option holds the name of the board and is used to located the files
	related to the board in the source tree (under boards/).
	The Board is the first location where we search for a linker.ld file,
	if not found we look for the linker file in
	arch/<arch>/soc/<family>/<series>
