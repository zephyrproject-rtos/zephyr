	  This option tells the build system that the target system is
	  using a 64-bit address space, meaning that pointer and long types
	  are 64 bits wide. This option is selected by arch/$ARCH/Kconfig,

	help
	  Select this option to enable building a Secure firmware
	  image for a platform that supports Trusted Execution. A
	  Secure firmware image will execute in Secure state. It may
	  allow the CPU to execute in Non-Secure (Normal) state.
	  Therefore, a Secure firmware image shall be able to
	  configure security attributions of CPU resources (memory
	  areas, peripherals, interrupts, etc.) as well as to handle
	  faults, related to security violations. It may optionally
	  allow certain functions to be called from the Non-Secure
	  (Normal) domain.

config TRUSTED_EXECUTION_NONSECURE
	depends on !TRUSTED_EXECUTION_SECURE
	bool "Trusted Execution: Non-Secure firmware image"
	help
	  Select this option to enable building a Non-Secure
	  firmware image for a platform that supports Trusted
	  Execution. A Non-Secure firmware image will execute
	  in Non-Secure (Normal) state. Therefore, it shall not
	  access CPU resources (memory areas, peripherals,
	  interrupts etc.) belonging to the Secure domain.

endif # ARCH_HAS_TRUSTED_EXECUTION

config HW_STACK_PROTECTION
	bool "Hardware Stack Protection"
	depends on ARCH_HAS_STACK_PROTECTION
	help
	  Select this option to enable hardware-based platform features to
	  catch stack overflows when the system is running in privileged
	  mode. If CONFIG_USERSPACE is not enabled, the system is always
	  running in privileged mode.

	  Note that this does not necessarily prevent corruption and assertions
	  about the overall system state when a fault is triggered cannot be
	  made.

config USERSPACE
	bool "User mode threads"
	depends on ARCH_HAS_USERSPACE
	depends on RUNTIME_ERROR_CHECKS
	help
	  When enabled, threads may be created or dropped down to user mode,
	  which has significantly restricted permissions and must interact
	  with the kernel via system calls. See Zephyr documentation for more
	  details	about this feature.

	  If a user thread overflows its stack, this will be caught and the
	  kernel itself will be shielded from harm. Enabling this option
	  may or may not catch stack overflows when the system is in
	  privileged mode or handling a system call; to ensure these are always
	  caught, enable CONFIG_HW_STACK_PROTECTION.

config PRIVILEGED_STACK_SIZE
	int "Size of privileged stack"
	default 1024
	depends on ARCH_HAS_USERSPACE
	help
	  This option sets the privileged stack region size that will be used
	  in addition to the user mode thread stack.  During normal execution,
	  this region will be inaccessible from user mode.  During system calls,
	  this region will be utilized by the system call. This value must be
	  a multiple of the minimum stack alignment.

config KOBJECT_TEXT_AREA
	int "Size if kobject text area"
	default 512 if COVERAGE_GCOV
	default 512 if NO_OPTIMIZATIONS
	default 256
	depends on ARCH_HAS_USERSPACE
	help
	  Size of kernel object text area. Used in linker script.

config GEN_PRIV_STACKS
	bool
	help
	  Selected if the architecture requires that privilege elevation stacks
	  be allocated in a separate memory area. This is typical of arches
	  whose MPUs require regions to be power-of-two aligned/sized.

	  FIXME: This should be removed and replaced with checks against
	  CONFIG_MPU_REQUIRES_POWER_OF_TWO_ALIGNMENT, but both ARM and ARC
	  changes will be necessary for this.

config STACK_GROWS_UP
	bool "Stack grows towards higher memory addresses"
	help
	  Select this option if the architecture has upward growing thread
	  stacks. This is not common.

config NO_UNUSED_STACK_INSPECTION
	bool
	help
	  Selected if the architecture will generate a fault if unused stack
	  memory is examined, which is the region between the current stack
	  pointer and the deepest available address in the current stack
	  region.

config MAX_THREAD_BYTES
	int "Bytes to use when tracking object thread permissions"
	default 2
	depends on USERSPACE
	help
	  Every kernel object will have an associated bitfield to store
	  thread permissions for that object. This controls the size of the
	  bitfield (in bytes) and imposes a limit on how many threads can
	  be created in the system.

config DYNAMIC_OBJECTS
	bool "Allow kernel objects to be allocated at runtime"
	depends on USERSPACE
	help
	  Enabling this option allows for kernel objects to be requested from
	  the calling thread's resource pool, at a slight cost in performance
	  due to the supplemental run-time tables required to validate such
	  objects.

	  Objects allocated in this way can be freed with a supervisor-only
	  API call, or when the number of references to that object drops to
	  zero.

config NOCACHE_MEMORY
	bool "Support for uncached memory"
	depends on ARCH_HAS_NOCACHE_MEMORY_SUPPORT
	help
	  Add a "nocache" read-write memory section that is configured to
	  not be cached. This memory section can be used to perform DMA
	  transfers when cache coherence issues are not optimal or can not
	  be solved using cache maintenance operations.

menu "Interrupt Configuration"

config DYNAMIC_INTERRUPTS
	bool "Enable installation of IRQs at runtime"
	help
	  Enable installation of interrupts at runtime, which will move some
	  interrupt-related data structures to RAM instead of ROM, and
	  on some architectures increase code size.

config GEN_ISR_TABLES
	bool "Use generated IRQ tables"
	help
	  This option controls whether a platform uses the gen_isr_tables
	  script to generate its interrupt tables. This mechanism will create
	  an appropriate hardware vector table and/or software IRQ table.

config GEN_IRQ_VECTOR_TABLE
	bool "Generate an interrupt vector table"
	default y
	depends on GEN_ISR_TABLES
	help
	  This option controls whether a platform using gen_isr_tables
	  needs an interrupt vector table created. Only disable this if the
	  platform does not use a vector table at all, or requires the vector
	  table to be in a format that is not an array of function pointers
	  indexed by IRQ line. In the latter case, the vector table must be
	  supplied by the application or architecture code.

config GEN_SW_ISR_TABLE
	bool "Generate a software ISR table"
	default y
	depends on GEN_ISR_TABLES
	help
	  This option controls whether a platform using gen_isr_tables
	  needs a software ISR table table created. This is an array of struct
	  _isr_table_entry containing the interrupt service routine and supplied
	  parameter.

config ARCH_SW_ISR_TABLE_ALIGN
	int "Alignment size of a software ISR table"
	default 0
	depends on GEN_SW_ISR_TABLE
	help
	  This option controls alignment size of generated
	  _sw_isr_table.  Some architecture needs a software ISR table
	  to be aligned to architecture specific size.  The default
	  size is 0 for no alignment.

config GEN_IRQ_START_VECTOR
	int
	default 0
	depends on GEN_ISR_TABLES
	help
	  On some architectures, part of the vector table may be reserved for
	  system exceptions and is declared separately from the tables
	  created by gen_isr_tables.py. When creating these tables, this value
	  will be subtracted from CONFIG_NUM_IRQS to properly size them.
	  This is a hidden option which needs to be set per architecture and
	  left alone.

config IRQ_OFFLOAD
	bool "Enable IRQ offload"
	depends on TEST
	help
	  Enable irq_offload() API which allows functions to be synchronously
	  run in interrupt context. Only useful for test cases that need
	  to validate the correctness of kernel objects in IRQ context.

	  support multiple page sizes, put the smallest one here.

config MEMORY_PROTECTION
	bool
	help
	  This option is enabled when Memory Protection features are supported.
	  Memory protection support is currently available on ARC, ARM, and x86
	  architectures.

config MPU_REQUIRES_POWER_OF_TWO_ALIGNMENT
	bool
	help
	  This option is enabled when the MPU requires a power of two alignment
	  and size for MPU regions.

config MPU_REQUIRES_NON_OVERLAPPING_REGIONS
	bool
	help
	  This option is enabled when the MPU requires the active (i.e. enabled)
	  MPU regions to be non-overlapping with each other.

config MPU_GAP_FILLING
	bool "Force MPU to be filling in background memory regions"
	depends on MPU_REQUIRES_NON_OVERLAPPING_REGIONS
	default y if !USERSPACE
	help
	  This Kconfig option instructs the MPU driver to enforce
	  a full kernel SRAM partitioning, when it programs the
	  dynamic MPU regions (user thread stack, PRIV stack guard
	  and application memory domains) during context-switch. We
	  allow this to be a configurable option, in order to be able
	  to switch the option off and have an increased number of MPU
	  regions available for application memory domain programming.

	  Notes:
	  An increased number of MPU regions should only be required,
	  when building with USERSPACE support. As a result, when we
	  build without USERSPACE support, gap filling should always
	  be required.

	  When the option is switched off, access to memory areas not
	  covered by explicit MPU regions is restricted to privileged
	  code on an ARCH-specific basis. Refer to ARCH-specific
	  documentation for more information on how this option is
	  used.

menu "Floating Point Options"

config FPU
	bool "Enable floating point unit (FPU)"
	depends on CPU_HAS_FPU
	depends on ARC || ARM || RISCV || X86
	help
	  This option enables the hardware Floating Point Unit (FPU), in order to
	  support using the floating point registers and instructions.

	  When this option is enabled, by default, threads may use the floating
	  point registers only in an exclusive manner, and this usually means that
	  only one thread may perform floating point operations.

	  If it is necessary for multiple threads to perform concurrent floating
	  point operations, the "FPU register sharing" option must be enabled to
	  preserve the floating point registers across context switches.

	  Note that this option cannot be selected for the platforms that do not
	  include a hardware floating point unit; the floating point support for
	  those platforms is dependent on the availability of the toolchain-
	  provided software floating point library.

config FPU_SHARING
	bool "FPU register sharing"
	depends on FPU
	help
	  This option enables preservation of the hardware floating point registers
	  across context switches to allow multiple threads to perform concurrent
	  floating point operations.
